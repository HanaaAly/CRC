This study conducted an empirical evaluation of two interpretability techniques, global surrogate and local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME). Experiments on two black boxes, a multilayer perceptron, and support vector machines were carried out on two breast cancer tabular datasets. The results show that local interpretability can work along the global one to provide insights into the model. Quantitative evaluations show that the global surrogate slightly outperforms LIME. Interpretability techniques have the potential to fix the interpretability trade-off for opaque models."

To this end, the European Union passed the EU AI Act, proposing solution strategies that can be summarized under the umbrella term trustworthiness. In anti-cancer drug sensitivity prediction, machine learning (ML) methods are developed for application in medical decision support systems, which require an extraordinary level of trustworthiness. This review offers an overview of the ML landscape of methods for anti-cancer drug sensitivity prediction, including a brief introduction to the four major ML realms (supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, and reinforcement learning). In particular, we address the question to what extent trustworthiness-related properties, more specifically, interpretability and reliability, have been incorporated into anti-cancer drug sensitivity prediction methods over the previous decade. In total, we analyzed 36 papers with approaches for anti-cancer drug sensitivity prediction. Our results indicate that the need for reliability has hardly been addressed so far. Interpretability, on the other hand, has often been considered for model development. However, the concept is rather used intuitively, lacking clear definitions. Thus, we propose an easily extensible taxonomy for interpretability, unifying all prevalent connotations explicitly or implicitly used within the field."

A Framework for Interpretability in Machine Learning for Medical Imaging	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Interpretability; explainability; medical imaging; machine learning	RADIOMICS; FUTURE; AUTOMATION; CANCER; IMAGES; BIAS; AI	"Interpretability for machine learning models in medical imaging (MLMI) is an important direction of research. However, there is a general sense of murkiness in what interpretability means. Why does the need for interpretability in MLMI arise? What goals does one actually seek to address when interpretability is needed? To answer these questions, we identify a need to formalize the goals and elements of interpretability in MLMI. By reasoning about real-world tasks and goals common in both medical image analysis and its intersection with machine learning, we identify five core elements of interpretability: localization, visual recognizability, physical attribution, model transparency, and actionability. From this, we arrive at a framework for interpretability in MLMI, which serves as a step-by-step guide to approaching interpretability in this context. Overall, this paper formalizes interpretability needs in the context of medical imaging, and our applied perspective clarifies concrete MLMI-specific goals and considerations in order to guide method design and improve real-world usage. Our goal is to provide practical and didactic information for model designers and practitioners, inspire developers of models in the medical imaging field to reason more deeply about what interpretability is achieving, and suggest future directions of interpretability research."

However, most direct applications of DL will deliver models with limited transparency and explainability, which constrain their deployment in biomedical settings.MethodsThis systematic review discusses DL models used to support inference in cancer biology with a particular emphasis on multi-omics analysis. It focuses on how existing models address the need for better dialogue with prior knowledge, biological plausibility and interpretability, fundamental properties in the biomedical domain. For this, we retrieved and analyzed 42 studies focusing on emerging architectural and methodological advances, the encoding of biological domain knowledge and the integration of explainability methods.ResultsWe discuss the recent evolutionary arch of DL models in the direction of integrating prior biological relational and network knowledge to support better generalisation (e.g. pathways or Protein-Protein-Interaction networks) and interpretability. This represents a fundamental functional shift towards models which can integrate mechanistic and statistical inference aspects. We introduce a concept of bio-centric interpretability and according to its taxonomy, we discuss representational methodologies for the integration of domain prior knowledge in such models.ConclusionsThe paper provides a critical outlook into contemporary methods for explainability and interpretability used in DL for cancer. The analysis points in the direction of a convergence between encoding prior knowledge and improved interpretability. We introduce bio-centric interpretability which is an important step towards formalisation of biological interpretability of DL models and developing methods that are less problem- or application-specific."

A cohort study was conducted in which 130 (self-)employed cancer survivors completed the QWLQ-CS at baseline and 107 at follow-up and six single-item external anchors to measure change. Cancer survivors were diagnosed between 3 months and 10 years previously. To measure responsiveness we assessed the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of Receiver Operation Characteristic (ROC). To assess interpretability we compared Minimal Important Change (MIC) to Smallest Detectable Change at group level (SDC_group). The MIC was based on the mean change method and the SDC on the measurement error. We found sufficient responsiveness for improvement with AUC of 0.72 and sufficient interpretability with MIC (3.9) exceeding the SDC_group (2.8). Accordingly, we found sufficient responsiveness for deterioration with AUC of 0.27 and sufficient interpretability with MIC (-7.4) exceeding SDC_group (2.8). An improvement of 3.9 on the QWLQ-CS is meaningful to cancer survivors as is a deterioration of -7.4, both of which can be reliably measured at group level. The QWLQ-CS can be used as a patient-reported outcome measurement (PROM) of an intervention in research or practice at group level."	"[Tamminga, Sietske J.; de Jong, Merel; Frings-Dresen, Monique H.

Here we developed P-NET-a biologically informed deep learning model-to stratify patients with prostate cancer by treatment-resistance state and evaluate molecular drivers of treatment resistance for therapeutic targeting through complete model interpretability. We demonstrate that P-NET can predict cancer state using molecular data with a performance that is superior to other modelling approaches. Moreover, the biological interpretability within P-NET revealed established and novel molecularly altered candidates, such as MDM4 and FGFR1, which were implicated in predicting advanced disease and validated in vitro.

Interpretability contributes to increase the usability of the method. Also, it is relevant in decision support systems, such as in medical applications. White-box models like tree-based, rule-based and linear models are considered the most comprehensible, but less accurate or simplistic. In contrast, black-box models like nonlinear and ensemble models are more accurate hence more complex to interpret. Thus, a trade-off between accuracy and interpretability is often made when building models to support human experts in a decision-making process. Artificial hydrocarbon networks (AHN) is a supervised learning method that has been proved to be very effective for regression and classification problems. In fact, its training process suggests a kind of interpretability. Thus, the objective of this work is to present first efforts proving the capacity of artificial hydrocarbon networks (AHN) to deliver interpretable models. In order to assess the interpretability of AHN, we address the breast cancer problem using a public dataset. Results showed that AHN can be transformed in tree-based and rule-based models preserving high accuracy in the output classification."

Data Mining techniques have always assisted BC tasks whether it is screening, diagnosis, prognosis, treatment, monitoring, and/or management. Nowadays, the use of Data Mining is witnessing a new era. In fact, the main objective is no longer to replace humans but to enhance their capabilities, which is why Artificial Intelligence is now referred to as Intelligence Augmentation. In this context, interpretability is used to help domain experts learn new patterns and machine learning experts debug their models. This paper aims to investigate three black-boxes interpretation techniques: Feature Importance, Partial Dependence Plot, and LIME when applied to two types of feed-forward Artificial Neural Networks: Multilayer perceptrons, and Radial Basis Function Network, trained on the Wisconsin Original dataset for breast cancer diagnosis. Results showed that local LIME explanations were instance-level interpretations that came in line with the global interpretations of the other two techniques.

However, the black-box nature of such applications makes it difficult for physicians to trust the predicted decisions, subsequently preventing the proliferation of such applications in the clinical workflow. In this work, we aim to address this challenge by developing an interpretable skin cancer diagnosis approach using clinical images. Accordingly, a skin cancer diagnosis model consolidated with two interpretability methods is developed. The first interpretability method integrates skin cancer diagnosis domain knowledge, characterized by a skin lesion taxonomy, into model development, whereas the other method focuses on visualizing the decision-making process by highlighting the dominant of interest regions of skin lesion images. The proposed model is trained and validated on clinical images since the latter are easily obtainable by non-specialist healthcare providers. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of incorporating lesion taxonomy in improving model classification accuracy, where our model can predict the skin lesion origin as melanocytic or non-melanocytic with an accuracy of 87%, predict lesion malignancy with 77% accuracy, and provide disease diagnosis with an accuracy of 71%. In addition, the implemented interpretability methods assist understand the model's decision-making process and detecting misdiagnoses. This work is a step toward achieving interpretability in skin cancer diagnosis using clinical images. The developed approach can assist general practitioners to make an early diagnosis, thus reducing the redundant referrals that expert dermatologists receive for further investigations."

Our study brings interpretability to a Breast Cancer Risk (BCR) prediction by exploring whether the model relies on the laterality of the breast, where cancer ultimately develops, and how this reliance evolves over time. Methods: A dataset of 1210 Full-Field-Digital-Mammography exams with 0-7 Years To Cancer was used. MIRAI model was employed for BCR predictions. To determine which side of the breast contributed the most to the BCR prediction, the signal difference between left and right breasts was calculated for eight attribution-based interpretability techniques. AUC was calculated to investigate whether the BCR prediction is predominantly made from the breast, where the cancer ultimately develops. Results: For 0-1 Years To Cancer, the model predominantly predicts BCR based on the side of the breast where the cancer is already present AUC=0.92-0.95. The top-performing attribution methods achieved an AUC of 0.70 for mammograms captured 1-3 Years To Cancer. For exams that were 3-5 Years To Cancer, a significant drop to AUC of 0.57 was observed. When moving to 5-7 Years To Cancer, focus on the breast with future cancer becomes random. Conclusions: All attribution methods showed that BCR predictions extending beyond three years from screen-detected cancer are most likely based on typical breast characteristics, such as density and other long-standing tissue patterns; however, for short-term BCR predictions, the model seems to detect early signs of tumor development."

If its diagnosis occur soon enough, the probability to achieve the cure of the patient can be increased. Recently, it has been more common the use of deep neural network techniques to aid pathologists in their prognosis, but they still do not fully trust them because they lack interpretability. In light of that, this work investigates if previous training of the models as encoders could enhance their accuracy in both classification and interpretability. There were implemented three models to the BreakHis and BreCaHAD dataset: NASNet Mobile, DenseNET201, and MobileNetV2. The experiments have shown that the three models increased the classification performance and two models improved their interpretability using the proposed strategy. DenseNet201 encoder has performed almost 23% better than its vanilla version in classifying a tumor and the NASNet Mobile encoder has improved 28.5% in its tumor interpretation."

MethodsIn this study, interpretable pathological image analysis strategies are established to help medical experts to identify MSI. The strategies only require ubiquitous hematoxylin and eosin-stained whole-slide images and perform well in the three cohorts collected from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Equipped with machine learning and image processing technique, intelligent models are established to diagnose MSI based on pathological images, providing the rationale of the decision in both image level and pathological feature level. FindingsThe strategies achieve two levels of interpretability. First, the image-level interpretability is achieved by generating localization heat maps of important regions based on deep learning. Second, the feature-level interpretability is attained through feature importance and pathological feature interaction analysis. Interestingly, from both the image-level and feature-level interpretability, color and texture characteristics, as well as their interaction, are shown to be mostly contributed to the MSI prediction. InterpretationThe developed transparent machine learning pipeline is able to detect MSI efficiently and provide comprehensive clinical insights to pathologists. The comprehensible heat maps and features in the intelligent pipeline reflect extra- and intra-cellular acid-base balance shift in MSI tumor."

Considering the interpretability of Transformer models, and the power of graph networks in analyzing the inherent hierarchy of biological signals, a combined approach would be the next generation solution in computer aided interventions. In this study, we propose a framework for classification and visualization of surgical mass spectrometry data using Graph Transformer model to empower the interpretability of breast surgical margin assessment. METHODS: Using the iKnife, 144 burns (103 normal, 41 cancer) were collected and converted to multi-level graph structures. A Graph Transformer model was modified to output the intermediate attention parameters of the network. Beside ablation and prospective study, we propose multiple attention visualization approaches to facilitate the interpretability. RESULTS: In a 4-fold cross validation experiment, an average classification AUC of 95.6% was achieved, outperforming baseline models. We could also distinguish and visualize clear pattern of attention difference between burns. For instance, cancerous and normal burns gather more attention in the lower and higher subbands of the spectra respectively. Looking at cancer subtype prospectively, a pattern of cancer progression was also observed in the attention features. CONCLUSION: Graph Transformers are powerful in providing high network interpretability. When paired with proper visualization, they can be deployed for computer assisted interventions."

In other words, a patient may receive a different diagnosis from different pathologists, or inexperienced pathologists may misdiagnose. In this work, we implement five Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and evaluate classification accuracy and interpretability from real tumour images. To evaluate our models, we propose a metric to assess the interpretability of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs).

In the search for breast cancer drug candidate compounds, it is important to establish an effective quantitative structure-activity relationship for drug research and development. Neural networks have achieved high accuracy in this field, but with shortcomings of a large number of parameters, high model complexity, and poor interpretability. Therefore, a Serial Fuzzy System built by Subtractive clustering and ANFIS (SFSSA) layer by layer is proposed to explore a solution with better interpretability. Through the experiment in the bioactivity data set of candidate compounds with several models, the following conclusions are found: 1) The precision of SFSSA is better than that of classic linear regression; 2) SFSSA has fewer parameters and rules, and has better interpretability and generalization ability than classic neural network algorithms; 3) SFSSA has less training time and higher prediction accuracy than optimized TSK fuzzy system algorithm MBGD-RDA (Minibatch Gradient Descent with Regularization, DropRule, and AdaBound); 4) SFSSA's subsystem with 15 inputs achieved best prediction effect. In short, SFSSA provides a new way to apply fuzzy systems for high-dimensional regression problems."

In this context, some decision-support systems, mostly based on deep learning techniques, have already been approved for clinical purposes. Despite all the efforts in introducing artificial intelligence methods in the workflow of clinicians, its lack of interpretability - understand how the methods make decisions - still inhibits their dissemination in clinical practice. The aim of this article is to present an easy guide for oncologists explaining how these methods make decisions and illustrating the strategies to explain them. Theoretical concepts were illustrated based on oncological examples and a literature review of research works was performed from PubMed between January 2014 to September 2020, using deep learning techniques, interpretability and oncology as keywords. Overall, more than 60% are related to breast, skin or brain cancers and the majority focused on explaining the importance of tumor characteristics (e.g. dimension, shape) in the predictions. The most used computational methods are multilayer perceptrons and convolutional neural networks. Nevertheless, despite being successfully applied in different cancers scenarios, endowing deep learning techniques with interpretability, while maintaining their performance, continues to be one of the greatest challenges of artificial intelligence."

We use the question of predicting response to radiotherapy in colorectal cancer patients as an exemplar for developing prediction models that do provide such contextual information and therefore can effectively support clinical decision making. There is a growing body of evidence that about 30% of colorectal cancer patients do not respond to radiotherapy and will need alternative treatment. The consensus molecular subtypes for colorectal cancer (CMS) provide one such approach to categorising patients based on their disease biology. Here we select the CMS4 subtype as a proxy for stromal infiltration. By jointly predicting a patient's response to radiotherapy, the presence of CMS4, and the epithelial tissue map from morphological features extracted from standard H&E slides we provide a comprehensive clinically relevant assessment of a biopsy. A graph neural network is trained to achieve this joint prediction task, which subsequently provides novel interpretability maps to aid clinicians in their cancer treatment decision making process. Our model is trained and validated on two private rectal cancer datasets."

Precise pre-operative diagnosis of MVI by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is crucial for effective treatment of HCC. Compared with traditional methods, deep learning-based MVI diagnostic models have shown significant improvements. However, the black-box nature of deep learning models poses a challenge to their acceptance in medical fields that demand interpretability. To address this issue, this paper proposes an interpretable deep learning model, called Biosignature Identification Network (BIN) based on multi-modal MRI images for the liver cancer MVI prediction task. Inspired by the biological ways to distinguish the species through the biosignatures, our proposed BIN method classifies patients into MVI absence (i.e., Non-MVI or negative) and MVI presence (i.e., positive) by utilizing Non-MVI and MVI biosignatures. The adoption of a transparent decision-making process in BIN ensures interpretability, while the proposed biosignatures overcome the limitations associated with the manual feature extraction. Moreover, a multi-modal MRI based BIN method is also explored to further enhance the diagnostic performance with an attempt to interpretability of multi-modal MRI fusion. Through extensive experiments on the real dataset, it was found that BIN maintains deep model-level performance while providing effective interpretability. Overall, the proposed model offers a promising solution to the challenge of interpreting deep learning-based MVI diagnostic models."

Although, artificial intelligence (AI) methods have shown remarkable results towards this goal, their black box nature hinders their wide adoption in clinical practice. To address the need for AI guided breast cancer diagnosis, interpretability methods can be utilized. In this study, we used AI methods, i.e., Random Forests (RF), Neural Networks (NN) and Ensembles of Neural Networks (ENN), towards this goal and explained and optimized their performance through interpretability techniques, such as the Global Surrogate (GS) method, the Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE) plots and the Shapley values (SV). The Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) dataset of the open UCI repository was used for the training and evaluation of the AI algorithms. The best performance for breast cancer diagnosis was achieved by the proposed ENN (96.6% accuracy and 0.96 area under the ROC curve), and its predictions were explained by ICE plots, proving that its decisions were compliant with current medical knowledge and can be further utilized to gain new insights in the pathophysiological mechanisms of breast cancer.

In recent years, more and more deep-learning-based methods have been used for predicting cancer driver genes. However, deep-learning algorithms often have black box properties and cannot interpret the output results. Here, we propose a novel cancer driver gene mining method based on heterogeneous network meta-paths (MCDHGN), which uses meta-path aggregation to enhance the interpretability of predictions.Results MCDHGN constructs a heterogeneous network by using several types of multi-omics data that are biologically linked to genes. And the differential probabilities of SNV, DNA methylation, and gene expression data between cancerous tissues and normal tissues are extracted as initial features of genes. Nine meta-paths are manually selected, and the representation vectors obtained by aggregating information within and across meta-path nodes are used as new features for subsequent classification and prediction tasks. By comparing with eight homogeneous and heterogeneous network models on two pan-cancer datasets, MCDHGN has better performance on AUC and AUPR values. Additionally, MCDHGN provides interpretability of predicted cancer driver genes through the varying weights of biologically meaningful meta-paths.Availability and implementation https://github.com/1160300611/MCDHGN"	"[Wang, Lexiang; Zhou, Jingli; Wang, Xuan; Li, Junyi] Harbin Inst Technol Shenzhen, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China; [Wang, Xuan; Li, Junyi] Harbin Inst Technol Shenzhen, Guangdong Prov Key Lab Novel Secur Intelligence Te, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yadong] Harbin Inst Technol, Fac Comp, Ctr Bioinformat, Harbin 150001, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yadong; Li, Junyi] Harbin Inst Technol, Minist Educ, Key Lab Biol Bigdata, Harbin 150001, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China"	Harbin Institute of Technology; Harbin Institute of Technology; Harbin Institute of Technology; Harbin Institute of Technology	"Li, JY (corresponding author), Harbin Inst Technol Shenzhen, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China."	lijunyi@hit.edu.cn	"Li, Junyi/HNO-8819-2023"		"National Key R&D Program of China [2021YFA0910700]; Shenzhen Science and Technology University Stable Support Program [GXWD20201230155427003-202008212221120 01]; Shenzhen Science and Technology Program [JCYJ20200 109113201726]; Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation [2021A1515012461, 2021A1515 220115]; Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Novel Security Intelligence Technologies [2022B1212010005]"	National Key R&D Program of China; Shenzhen Science and Technology University Stable Support Program; Shenzhen Science and Technology Program; Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation; Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Novel Security Intelligence Technologies	"This work was supported by the grants from the National Key R&D Program of China [2021YFA0910700], Shenzhen Science and Technology University Stable Support Program [GXWD20201230155427003-202008212221120 01], Shenzhen Science and Technology Program [JCYJ20200 109113201726], Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation [2021A1515012461 and 2021A1515 220115], Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Novel Security Intelligence Technologies [2022B1212010005]."		27	0	0	4	4	OXFORD UNIV PRESS	OXFORD	"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND"	1367-4803	1367-4811		BIOINFORMATICS	Bioinformatics	JUN 24	2024	40	6							btae362	10.1093/bioinformatics/btae362	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btae362			8	"Biochemical Research Methods; Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Mathematical & Computational Biology; Statistics & Probability"	Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)	Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Computer Science; Mathematical & Computational Biology; Mathematics	WC8I8	38867699	gold			2024-09-17	WOS:001252758400002	View Full Record in Web of Science

For models exceeding human performance, e.g. predicting RNA structure from microscopy images, interpretable modelling can be further used to uncover highly non-trivial patterns which are otherwise imperceptible to the human eye. We show that interpretability can reveal connections between the microscopic appearance of cancer tissue and its gene expression profiling. While exhaustive profiling of all genes from the histology images is still challenging, we estimate the expression values of a well-known subset of genes that is indicative of cancer molecular subtype, survival, and treatment response in colorectal cancer. Our approach successfully identifies meaningful information from the image slides, highlighting hotspots of high gene expression. Our method can help characterise how gene expression shapes tissue morphology and this may be beneficial for patient stratification in the pathology unit. The code is available on GitHub."

Biology-inspired deep learning, where the architecture of the computational graph is based on biological knowledge, enables unique interpretability where real-world concepts are encoded in hidden nodes, which can be ranked by importance and thereby interpreted. In such models trained on single-cell transcriptomes, we previously demonstrated that node-level interpretations lack robustness upon repeated training and are influenced by biases in biological knowledge. Similar studies are missing for related models. Here, we test and extend our methodology for reliable interpretability in P-NET, a biology-inspired model trained on patient mutation data. We observe variability of interpretations and susceptibility to knowledge biases, and identify the network properties that drive interpretation biases. We further present an approach to control the robustness and biases of interpretations, which leads to more specific interpretations. In summary, our study reveals the broad importance of methods to ensure robust and bias-aware interpretability in biology-inspired deep learning."

We developed and validated a feature interpretability screening framework to identify high-risk populations and recommend colonoscopy for them.MethodsWe utilized a training cohort consisting of 1 252 605 participants who underwent colonoscopies in Shanghai from 2013 to 2015 to develop the screening framework. We incorporated Shapley additive explanation values into feature selection to provide interpretability for the framework. Two sampling methods were separately employed to mitigate potential model bias caused by class imbalance. Furthermore, we employed various machine learning algorithms to construct risk assessment models and compared their performance. We tested the screening models on an external validation cohort of 359 462 samples and conducted comprehensive evaluation and statistical analysis of the validation results.ResultsThe external validation results demonstrated that the models in the proposed framework achieved sensitivity over 0.734, specificity over 0.790, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve ranging from 0.808 to 0.859. In the predictions of the best-performing model, the prevalence rates of colorectal cancer were 0.059% and 1.056% in the low- and high-risk groups, respectively. If colonoscopies were performed only on the high-risk group predicted by the model, only 14.36% of total colonoscopies would be needed to detect 74.86% of colorectal cancer cases.ConclusionsWe developed and validated a novel framework to identify populations at high risk for colorectal cancer.

Though many computer-aided methods, especially deep learning methods, have made remarkable achievements in skin lesion diagnosis, their generalization and interpretability are still a challenge. To solve this issue, we propose an interpretability-based multimodal convolutional neural network (IM-CNN), which is a multiclass classification model with skin lesion images and metadata of patients as input for skin lesion diagnosis. The structure of IM-CNN consists of three main paths to deal with metadata, features extracted from segmented skin lesion with domain knowledge, and skin lesion images, respectively. We add interpretable visual modules to provide explanations for both images and metadata. In addition to area under the ROC curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity, we introduce a new indicator, an AUC curve with a sensitivity larger than 80% (AUC_SEN_80) for performance evaluation. Extensive experimental studies are conducted on the popular HAM10000 dataset, and the results indicate that the proposed model has overwhelming advantages compared with popular deep learning models, such as DenseNet, ResNet, and other state-of-the-art models for melanoma diagnosis. The proposed multimodal model also achieves on average 72% and 21% improvement in terms of sensitivity and AUC_SEN_80, respectively, compared with the single-modal model. The visual explanations can also help gain trust from dermatologists and realize man-machine collaborations, effectively reducing the limitation of black-box models in supporting medical decision making.\enlargethispage-8pt"	"[Wang, Sutong; Wang, Yanzhang] Dalian Univ Technol, Inst Informat & Decis Technol, Dalian 116000, Peoples R China; [Yin, Yunqiang] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Management & Econ, Chengdu 611731, Peoples R China; [Wang, Dujuan] Sichuan Univ, Business Sch, Chengdu 610064, Peoples R China; [Jin, Yaochu] Univ Surrey, Dept Comp Sci, Guildford GU2 7XH, Surrey, England"	Dalian University of Technology; University of Electronic Science & Technology of China; Sichuan University; University of Surrey	"Wang, DJ (corresponding author), Sichuan Univ, Business Sch, Chengdu 610064, Peoples R China.;Jin, YC (corresponding author), Univ Surrey, Dept Comp Sci, Guildford GU2 7XH, Surrey, England."	wangsutong@mail.dlut.edu.cn; yinyunqiang@126.com; djwang@scu.edu.cn; yzwang@dlut.edu.cn; yaochu.jin@surrey.ac.uk	"Jin, Yaochu/GRY-7004-2022; Wang, Dujuan/JFK-9849-2023; Wang, Yan-Zhang/C-6196-2012; Wang, Sutong/HNO-8634-2023; Jin, Yaochu/B-3776-2012"	"Wang, Dujuan/0000-0003-1617-7057; Wang, Sutong/0000-0001-6603-6047; Jin, Yaochu/0000-0003-1100-0631"	"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71871148, 71971041, 71533001]; Outstanding Young Scientific and Technological Talents Foundation of Sichuan Province [2020JDJQ0035]; Major Program of National Social Science Foundation of China [20ZD084]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2019YFB1404702]"	National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Outstanding Young Scientific and Technological Talents Foundation of Sichuan Province; Major Program of National Social Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key Research and Development Program of China(National Key Research & Development Program of China)	"This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 71871148, Grant 71971041, and Grant 71533001; in part by the Outstanding Young Scientific and Technological Talents Foundation of Sichuan Province under Grant 2020JDJQ0035; in part by the Major Program of National Social Science Foundation of China under Grant 20 & ZD084; and in part by National Key Research and Development Program of China under Grant 2019YFB1404702.

Bladder cancer staging is crucial to determine the effective treatments of bladder tumors in clinic. As to the superiority of feature learning, Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN) are widely used to predict the cancer stage based on medical images. However, most existing DCNN-based cancer staging methods are data-driven and neglect the domain knowledge and experiences of clinicians. Besides, the deep neural networks are short of model interpretability and may lead to risky diagnosis. To tackle the problems, we construct the diagnosis rules of bladder cancer staging based on the clinical experiences of tumor penetration into bladder wall. The diagnosis rules are extracted from Magnetic Resonance (MR) images and further integrated into DCNN for joint identification of tumor stage. The experiments validate that the integrated rules improve the model interpretability and guide DCNN to focus on the regions of tumor penetration and thereby produce precise prediction of cancer staging."

However, the vast quantities of molecular features produced and the inherent interplay between them lead to a level of complexity that hampers both descriptive and predictive tasks, requiring custom-built algorithms that can extract relevant information from these sources of data. We propose a transformation that moves data centered on molecules (e.g., transcripts and proteins) to a new data space focused on putative regulatory modules given by statistically relevant co-expression patterns. To this end, the proposed transformation extracts patterns from the data through biclustering and uses them to create new variables with guarantees of interpretability and discriminative power.

Transcriptomics-based cancer prognosis models, for example, while achieving good accuracy, are usually hard to interpret, due to the high-dimensional feature space and the complexity of models. As interpretability is critical for the transparency and fairness of ML models, several algorithms have been proposed to improve the interpretability of arbitrary classifiers. However, evaluation of these algorithms often requires substantial domain knowledge. Here, we propose a breast cancer metastasis prediction model using a very small number of biologically interpretable features, and a simple yet novel model interpretation approach that can provide personalized interpretations. In addition, we contributed, to the best of our knowledge, the first method to quantitatively compare different interpretation algorithms. Experimental results show that our model not only achieved competitive prediction accuracy, but also higher inter-classifier interpretation consistency than state-of-the-art interpretation methods. Importantly, our interpretation results can improve the generalizability of the prediction models. Overall, this work provides several novel ideas to construct and evaluate interpretable ML models that can be valuable to both the cancer machine learning community and related application domains."

It represents a group of histologically and molecularly heterogeneous diseases even within the same histological subtype. Moreover, accurate histological subtype diagnosis influences the specific subtype's target genes, which will help define the treatment plan to target those genes in therapy. Deep learning (DL) models seem to set the benchmarks for the tasks of cancer prediction and subtype classification when using gene expression data; however, these methods do not provide interpretability, which is great concern from the perspective of cancer biology since the identification of the cancer driver genes in an individual provides essential information for treatment and prognosis. In this work, we identify some limitations of previous work that showed efforts to build algorithms to extract feature weights from DL models, and we propose using tree-based learning algorithms that address these limitations.

Drug sensitivity assays, combined with profiling of cancer cell lines and drugs become increasingly available for training such models. Multiple methods were proposed for predicting drug sensitivity from cancer cell line features, some in a multi-task fashion. So far, no such model leveraged drug inhibition profiles. Importantly, multi-task models require a tailored approach to model interpretability. In this work, we develop DEERS, a neural network recommender system for kinase inhibitor sensitivity prediction. The model utilizes molecular features of the cancer cell lines and kinase inhibition profiles of the drugs. DEERS incorporates two autoencoders to project cell line and drug features into 10-dimensional hidden representations and a feed-forward neural network to combine them into response prediction. We propose a novel interpretability approach, which in addition to the set of modeled features considers also the genes and processes outside of this set. Our approach outperforms simpler matrix factorization models, achieving R = 0.82 correlation between true and predicted response for the unseen cell lines. The interpretability analysis identifies 67 biological processes that drive the cell line sensitivity to particular compounds. Detailed case studies are shown for PHA-793887, XMD14-99 and Dabrafenib."

IBPGNET can integrate different omics data efficiently and provide global interpretability. In addition, our experimental results show that IBPGNET outperforms other classification methods in 5-fold cross-validation. IBPGNET identified PSMC1 and PSMD11 as genes associated with LUAD recurrence, and their expression levels were significantly higher in LUAD cells than in normal cells. The knockdown of PSMC1 and PSMD11 in LUAD cells increased their sensitivity to afatinib and decreased cell migration, invasion and proliferation. In addition, the cells showed significantly lower EGFR expression, indicating that PSMC1 and PSMD11 may mediate therapeutic sensitivity through EGFR expression."

However, using confounding/irrelevant information in making predictions by deep learning models, even the interpretable ones, poses critical challenges to their clinical acceptance. That has recently drawn researchers' attention to issues beyond the mere interpretation of deep learning models. In this paper, we first investigate application of an inherently interpretable prototype-based architecture, known as ProtoPNet, for breast cancer classification in digital pathology and highlight its shortcomings in this application. Then, we propose a new method that uses more medically relevant information and makes more accurate and interpretable predictions. Our method leverages the clustering concept and implicitly increases the number of classes in the training dataset. The proposed method learns more relevant prototypes without any pixel-level annotated data. To have a more holistic assessment, in addition to classification accuracy, we define a new metric for assessing the degree of interpretability based on the comments of a group of skilled pathologists. Experimental results on the BreakHis dataset show that the proposed method effectively improves the classification accuracy and interpretability by respectively 8% and 18%. Therefore, the proposed method can be seen as a step toward implementing interpretable deep learning models for the detection of breast cancer using histopathology images."

In this work, we apply a weakly supervised learning algorithm to a real-world dataset of this type for the first time, with over 85% validation accuracy and over 87% test accuracy. We then employ interpretability methods including attention heatmapping, feature visualization, and a novel end-to-end saliency-mapping approach to identify distinct morphologies learned by the model and build an understanding of its behavior. These interpretability methods, alongside consultation with expert pathologists, allow us to make comparisons between machine-learned knowledge and consensus in the field.

One of the major challenges of cancer surgery remains the complete removal of the tumor. Therefore, numerous studies have proposed to design automatic systems aimed at supporting physicians during the surgery. As an optical imaging modality, hyperspectral imaging (HSI) simultaneously captures spatial and spectral features to bring additional insight to surgeons in a label-free manner. However, to the best of our knowledge, previous effort on medical HSI lacks attention to the interpretability of decisions, which greatly hinders the application of HSI in safety-critical scenarios. Through the intrinsic correlation between tissue composition and its spectrum, hyperspectral images can be interpreted according to different spectral characteristics. Generally, interpretability of spectral images often employs a physical model of light interact with tissues. Such an approach has been long practiced in tissue optics, e.g., diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS). Recent advances in deep learning showed state-of-the-art performance on both detection and segmentation of malignant tissues, breaking through the bottleneck of traditional methods in real-time applications. However, due to the lack of interpretability of the deep learning model, the reliability of the results becomes an issue. In this work, we develop and evaluate a diffusion model-based and a deep learning-based interpretable spectral imaging model, respectively, in the context of liver tumor delineation from clinical hyperspectral image dataset. Notably, both methods point to a key sign of abnormality is the difference in bile volume fraction, which could lay the foundation for the interpretability and system design of the spectral imaging system in practical use."

However, current methods ignore the potential correlations between samples in integrating multi-omics data. In addition, providing accurate biological explanations still poses significant challenges due to the complexity of deep learning models. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a deep learning-based multi-omics integration method to explore the potential correlations between samples and provide model interpretability. Herein, we propose a novel interpretable multi-omics data integration method (DeepKEGG) for cancer recurrence prediction and biomarker discovery. In DeepKEGG, a biological hierarchical module is designed for local connections of neuron nodes and model interpretability based on the biological relationship between genes/miRNAs and pathways. In addition, a pathway self-attention module is constructed to explore the correlation between different samples and generate the potential pathway feature representation for enhancing the prediction performance of the model. Lastly, an attribution-based feature importance calculation method is utilized to discover biomarkers related to cancer recurrence and provide a biological interpretation of the model. Experimental results demonstrate that DeepKEGG outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in 5-fold cross validation. Furthermore, case studies also indicate that DeepKEGG serves as an effective tool for biomarker discovery. The code is available at https://github.com/lanbiolab/DeepKEGG."

Histopathological image analysis is the gold standard for diagnosing different differentiation types of esophageal cancer. Purpose The grading accuracy and interpretability of the auxiliary diagnostic model for esophageal cancer are seriously affected by small interclass differences, imbalanced data distribution, and poor model interpretability. Therefore, we focused on developing the category imbalance attention block network (CIABNet) model to try to solve the previous problems. Methods First, the quantitative metrics and model visualization results are integrated to transfer knowledge from the source domain images to better identify the regions of interest (ROI) in the target domain of esophageal cancer. Second, in order to pay attention to the subtle interclass differences, we propose the concatenate fusion attention block, which can focus on the contextual local feature relationships and the changes of channel attention weights among different regions simultaneously. Third, we proposed a category imbalance attention module, which treats each esophageal cancer differentiation class fairly based on aggregating different intensity information at multiple scales and explores more representative regional features for each class, which effectively mitigates the negative impact of category imbalance. Finally, we use feature map visualization to focus on interpreting whether the ROIs are the same or similar between the model and pathologists, thus better improving the interpretability of the model. Results The experimental results show that the CIABNet model outperforms other state-of-the-art models, which achieves the most advanced results in classifying the differentiation types of esophageal cancer with an average classification accuracy of 92.24%, an average precision of 93.52%, an average recall of 90.31%, an average F1 value of 91.73%, and an average AUC value of 97.43%. In addition, the CIABNet model has essentially similar or identical to the ROI of pathologists in identifying histopathological images of esophageal cancer. Conclusions Our experimental results prove that our proposed computer-aided diagnostic algorithm shows great potential in histopathological images of multi-differentiated types of esophageal cancer."

Computational methods provide a cost-effective means to explore lncRNA-disease associations (LDAs). However, these methods often lack interpretability, leaving their predictions less convincing to biological and medical researchers. We propose an interpretable and knowledge-informed heterogeneous graph learning framework based on graph patch convolution and integrated gradients to predict LDAs and provides intuitive explanations for its predictions, called X-LDA. The heterogeneous graph is the foundation of the predictions of LDAs, we construct the knowledge-informed heterogeneous graph including LDAs drawn from biological experiments, lncRNA similarities rooted in gene sequences, disease similarities constructed based on disease categorizations. To integrate diverse biological premises and facilitate interpretability, we define nine distinct graph patch types, which encapsulate essential topological relationships within lncRNA-disease node pairs. X-LDA is designed to employ parameter sharing and multi-convolution kernels to grasp common and multiple perspectives of the graph patches, respectively. This approach culminates in the fusion of various semantic information into context embeddings. These post-hoc explanations hinge on graph patch features and integrated gradients, shedding light on the underlying factors driving predictions. Cross validation experiment on the dataset curated from databases and literatures demonstrates that the superior performance of X-LDA in comparison to nine state-of-the-art methods of three categories. X-LDA achieves a larger average area under the receiver operating curve 0.9891 (by at least 6.68%), and a larger average area under the precision-recall curve 0.7907 (by at least 23.2%) than competitive methods. The results of our well-designed ablation and interpretability experiments and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis demonstrate X-LDA's robustness, learnability, predictability, and interpretability. The applicability of X-LDA is also demonstrated through a case study involving the investigation of associated lncRNAs in prostate cancer, colorectal cancer, and breast cancer."

Machine Learning and, in particular, Deep Neural Networks are behind this revolution. Among the most challenging targets of interest in medicine are cancer diagnosis and therapies but, to start this revolution, software tools need to be adapted to cover the new requirements. In this sense, learning tools are becoming a commodity but, to be able to assist doctors on a daily basis, it is essential to fully understand how models can be interpreted. In this survey, we analyse current machine learning models and other in-silico tools as applied to medicine-specifically, to cancer research-and we discuss their interpretability, performance and the input data they are fed with. Artificial neural networks (ANN), logistic regression (LR) and support vector machines (SVM) have been observed to be the preferred models. In addition, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), supported by the rapid development of graphic processing units (GPUs) and high-performance computing (HPC) infrastructures, are gaining importance when image processing is feasible. However, the interpretability of machine learning predictions so that doctors can understand them, trust them and gain useful insights for the clinical practice is still rarely considered, which is a factor that needs to be improved to enhance doctors' predictive capacity and achieve individualised therapies in the near future."

This trend is known as XAI and brings certain advantages such as increased confidence in the decision-making process, improved capacity for error analysis, verification of results and possibility of model refinement, among others. In this work we have focused on interpreting the predictions of recently developed deep learning models through different visualization techniques. The use case we introduce is the detection of breast cancer through the classification of mammographies, since the medical field is widely benefited by the contributions of XAI methods. Furthermore, the target neural networks are based on recent and poorly explored architectures: EfficientNet, designed to improve the performance of convolutional networks."

Multiple molecular assays have been proposed to identify the tissue of origin (TOO) and inform clinical care; however, none has been able to combine accuracy, interpretability, and easy access for routine use. We developed a classifier tool based on the training of a variational autoencoder to predict tissue of origin based on RNA-sequencing data. We used as training data 20,918 samples corresponding to 94 different categories, including 39 cancer types and 55 normal tissues. The TransCUPtomics classifier was applied to a retrospective cohort of 37 CUP patients and 11 prospective patients. TransCUPtomics exhibited an overall accuracy of 96% on reference data for TOO prediction. The TOO could be identified in 38 (79%) of 48 CUP patients. Eight of 11 prospective CUP patients (73%) could receive first-line therapy guided by TransCUPtomics prediction, with responses observed in most patients. The variational autoencoder added further utility by enabling prediction interpretability, and diagnostic predictions could be matched to detection of gene fusions and expressed variants. TransCUPtomics confidently predicted TOO for CUP and enabled tailored treatments leading to significant clinical responses. The interpretability of our approach is a powerful addition to improve the management of CUP patients."
