Measuring Quality of Life Using Patient-Reported Outcomes in Real-World Metastatic Breast Cancer Patients: The Need for a Standardized Approach	CANCERS			English	Review						metastatic breast cancer; quality of life; patient reported outcomes	EUROPEAN ORGANIZATION; CLINICAL-TRIALS; SYMPTOM BURDEN; EORTC QLQ-C30; SHORT-FORM; LONG-TERM; WOMEN; IMPACT; CHEMOTHERAPY; SURVIVAL	"Simple Summary Metastatic breast cancer (MBC) remains incurable despite treatment improvements. The health-related quality of life is a multidimensional entity which covers physical, psychological and social dimensions. It is an important outcome particularly in patients with metastatic disease, as the primary goal of therapy is no longer curation, but to provide the best possible quality of life weighted against treatment risks and adverse symptoms. Patient-reported outcomes reflecting the quality of life are usually measured with validated questionnaires to evaluate treatment strategies based on symptom burden and to improve care delivery. This review shares insights into the role of patient-reported outcome measurements in MBC patients and describes the heterogeneity of current questionnaires. We conclude that an up-to-date and standardized outcome set is needed, containing relevant domains referring to individual needs to improve the quality of life assessment among MBC patients. This is a prerequisite to learn about how they could impact the clinical care pathway. Metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients are almost always treated to minimize the symptom burden, and to prolong life without a curative intent. Although the prognosis of MBC patients has improved in recent years, the median survival after diagnosis is still only 3 years. Therefore, the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) should play a leading role in making treatment decisions. Heterogeneity in questionnaires used to evaluate the HRQoL in MBC patients complicates the interpretability and comparability of patient-reported outcomes (PROs) globally. In this review, we aimed to provide an overview of PRO instruments used in real-world MBC patients and to discuss important issues in measuring HRQoL. Routinely collecting symptom information using PROs could enhance treatment evaluation and shared decision-making. Standardizing these measures might help to improve the implementation of PROs, and facilitates collecting and sharing data to establish valid comparisons in research. This is a prerequisite to learn about how they could impact the clinical care pathway. In addition, the prognostic value of intensified PRO collection throughout therapy on survival and disease progression is promising. Future perspectives in the field of PROs and MBC are described."

For proper and effective management of oral cancer, early diagnosis and accurate prediction of prognosis are important. To achieve this, artificial intelligence (AI) or its subfield, machine learning, has been touted for its potential to revolutionize cancer management through improved diagnostic precision and prediction of outcomes. Yet, to date, it has made only few contributions to actual medical practice or patient care. Objectives: This study provides a systematic review of diagnostic and prognostic application of machine learning in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and also highlights some of the limitations and concerns of clinicians towards the implementation of machine learning-based models for daily clinical practice. Data sources: We searched OvidMedline, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) databases from inception until February 2020 for articles that used machine learning for diagnostic or prognostic purposes of OSCC. Eligibility criteria: Only original studies that examined the application of machine learning models for prognostic and/or diagnostic purposes were considered. Data extraction: Independent extraction of articles was done by two researchers (A.R. & O.Y) using predefine study selection criteria. We used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) in the searching and screening processes. We also used Prediction model Risk of Bias Assessment Tool (PROBAST) for assessing the risk of bias (ROB) and quality of included studies. Results: A total of 41 studies were published to have used machine learning to aid in the diagnosis/or prognosis of OSCC. The majority of these studies used the support vector machine (SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN) algorithms as machine learning techniques. Their specificity ranged from 0.57 to 1.00, sensitivity from 0.70 to 1.00, and accuracy from 63.4 % to 100.0 % in these studies. The main limitations and concerns can be grouped as either the challenges inherent to the science of machine learning or relating to the clinical implementations. Conclusion: Machine learning models have been reported to show promising performances for diagnostic and prognostic analyses in studies of oral cancer. These models should be developed to further enhance explainability, interpretability, and externally validated for generalizability in order to be safely integrated into daily clinical practices. Also, regulatory frameworks for the adoption of these models in clinical practices are necessary."

An interpretable machine learning approach to estimate the influence of inflammation biomarkers on cardiovascular risk assessment	COMPUTER METHODS AND PROGRAMS IN BIOMEDICINE			English	Article						Inflammation biomarkers; GRACE; Data Fusion; Interpretability; Personalization	CANCER	"Background and objective: Cardiovascular disease has a huge impact on health care services, originating unsustainable costs at clinical, social, and economic levels. In this context, patients' risk stratification tools are central to support clinical decisions contributing to the implementation of effective preventive health care. Although useful, these tools present some limitations, in particular, some lack of performance as well as the impossibility to consider new risk factors potentially important in the prognosis of severe car-diac events. Moreover, the actual use of these tools in the daily practice requires the physicians' trust. The main goal of this work addresses these two issues: (i) evaluate the importance of inflammation biomark-ers when combined with a risk assessment tool; (ii) incorporation of personalization and interpretability as key elements of that assessment.Methods: Firstly, machine learning based models were created to assess the potential of the inflam-mation biomarkers applied in secondary prevention, namely in the prediction of the six month risk of death/myocardial infarction. Then, an approach based on three main phases was created: (i) set of inter-pretable rules supported by clinical evidence; (ii) selection based on a machine learning classifier able to identify for a given patient the most suitable subset of rules; (iii) an ensemble scheme combining the previous subset of rules in the estimation of the patient cardiovascular risk. All the results were statis-tically validated ( t-test, Wilcoxon-signed rank test) according to a previous verification of data normality (Shapiro-Wilk).Results: The proposed methodology was applied to a real acute coronary syndrome patients dataset ( N = 1544) from the Cardiology Unit of Coimbra Hospital and Universitary centre. The first assessment was based on the GRACE tool and a Random Forest classifier, the incorporation of inflammation biomark-ers achieved SE = 0.83; SP = 0.84 whereas the original GRACE risk factors reached SE = 0.75; SP = 0.85. In the second phase, the proposed approach with inflammation biomarkers achieved SE = 0.763 and SP = 0.778. Conclusions: This approach confirms the potential of combining inflammation markers with the GRACE score, increasing SE and SP, when compared with the original GRACE. Additionally, it assures inter-pretability and personalization, which are critical issues to allow its application in the daily clinical prac-tice.(c) 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the reliability, validity, responsiveness and interpretability of the P-BAS HOP.MethodsA longitudinal study among hospitalised older patients with a baseline interview during hospitalisation and a follow-up by telephone 3 months after discharge. Test-retest reliability of the baseline and follow-up questionnaire were tested. Percentage of agreement, Cohen's kappa with quadratic weighting and maximum attainable kappa were calculated per item. The PBI was calculated for both test and retest of baseline and follow-up and compared with Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC). Construct validity was tested by evaluating pre-defined hypotheses comparing the priority of goals with experienced symptoms or limitations at admission and the achievement of goals with progression or deterioration of other constructs. Responsiveness was evaluated by correlating the PBI with the anchor question 'How much did you benefit from the admission?'. This question was also used to evaluate the interpretability of the PBI with the visual anchor-based minimal important change distribution method.ResultsReliability was tested with 53 participants at baseline and 72 at follow-up. Mean weighted kappa of the baseline items was 0.38. ICC between PBI of the test and retest was 0.77.Mean weighted kappa of the follow-up items was 0.51. ICC between PBI of the test and retest was 0.62.For the construct validity, tested in 451 participants, all baseline hypotheses were confirmed. From the follow-up hypotheses, tested in 344 participants, five of seven were confirmed.The Spearman's correlation coefficient between the PBI and the anchor question was 0.51.The optimal cut-off point was 0.7 for 'no important benefit' and 1.4 points for 'important benefit' on the PBI.ConclusionsAlthough the concept seems promising, the reliability and validity of the P-BAS HOP appeared to be not yet satisfactory. We therefore recommend adapting the P-BAS HOP."

Practitioners require access to the chain of reasoning behind CAD to build trust in the CAD advice and to supplement their own expertise. Yet, CAD systems might be based on black box machine learning models and high dimensional data sources such as electronic health records, magnetic resonance imaging scans, cardiotocograms, etc. These foundations make interpretation and explanation of the CAD advice very challenging. This challenge is recognised throughout the machine learning research community. eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is emerging as one of the most important research areas of recent years because it addresses the interpretability and trust concerns of critical decision makers, including those in clinical and medical practice. Methods In this work, we focus on AdaBoost, a black box model that has been widely adopted in the CAD literature. We address the challenge - to explain AdaBoost classification - with a novel algorithm that extracts simple, logical rules from AdaBoost models. Our algorithm,Adaptive-Weighted High Importance Path Snippets(Ada-WHIPS), makes use of AdaBoost's adaptive classifier weights. Using a novel formulation, Ada-WHIPS uniquely redistributes the weights among individual decision nodes of the internal decision trees of the AdaBoost model. Then, a simple heuristic search of the weighted nodes finds a single rule that dominated the model's decision. We compare the explanations generated by our novel approach with the state of the art in an experimental study. We evaluate the derived explanations with simple statistical tests of well-known quality measures, precision and coverage, and a novel measurestabilitythat is better suited to the XAI setting. Results Experiments on 9 CAD-related data sets showed that Ada-WHIPS explanations consistently generalise better (mean coverage 15%-68%) than the state of the art while remaining competitive for specificity (mean precision 80%-99%). A very small trade-off in specificity is shown to guard against over-fitting which is a known problem in the state of the art methods. Conclusions The experimental results demonstrate the benefits of using our novel algorithm for explaining CAD AdaBoost classifiers widely found in the literature. Our tightly coupled, AdaBoost-specific approach outperforms model-agnostic explanation methods and should be considered by practitioners looking for an XAI solution for this class of models."

In the present narrative review, we analyzed and discuss studies reporting on how AI algorithms could predict responses to various treatment modalities, such as surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy.Abstract Artificial Intelligence (AI) has revolutionized the management of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) by enhancing different aspects, including staging, prognosis assessment, treatment prediction, response evaluation, recurrence/prognosis prediction, and personalized prognostic assessment. AI algorithms may accurately classify NSCLC stages using machine learning techniques and deep imaging data analysis. This could potentially improve precision and efficiency in staging, facilitating personalized treatment decisions. Furthermore, there are data suggesting the potential application of AI-based models in predicting prognosis in terms of survival rates and disease progression by integrating clinical, imaging and molecular data. In the present narrative review, we will analyze the preliminary studies reporting on how AI algorithms could predict responses to various treatment modalities, such as surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy. There is robust evidence suggesting that AI also plays a crucial role in predicting the likelihood of tumor recurrence after surgery and the pattern of failure, which has significant implications for tailoring adjuvant treatments. The successful implementation of AI in personalized prognostic assessment requires the integration of different data sources, including clinical, molecular, and imaging data. Machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques enable AI models to analyze these data and generate personalized prognostic predictions, allowing for a precise and individualized approach to patient care. However, challenges relating to data quality, interpretability, and the ability of AI models to generalize need to be addressed. Collaboration among clinicians, data scientists, and regulators is critical for the responsible implementation of AI and for maximizing its benefits in providing a more personalized prognostic assessment.

Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a non-invasive, real-time, high-resolution imaging technology for cervical tissues. However, since the interpretation of cervical OCT images is a knowledge-intensive, time-consuming task, it is tough to acquire a large number of high-quality labeled images quickly, which is a big challenge for supervised learning. In this study, we introduce the vision Transformer (ViT) architecture, which has recently achieved impressive results in natural image analysis, into the classification task of cervical OCT images. Our work aims to develop a computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) approach based on a self-supervised ViT-based model to classify cervical OCT images effectively. We leverage masked autoencoders (MAE) to perform self-supervised pre-training on cervical OCT images, so the proposed classification model has a better transfer learning ability. In the fine-tuning process, the ViT-based classification model extracts multi-scale features from OCT images of different resolutions and fuses them with the cross-attention module. The ten-fold cross-validation results on an OCT image dataset from a multi-center clinical study of 733 patients in China indicate that our model achieved an AUC value of 0.9963 +/- 0.0069 with a 95.89 +/- 3.30% sensitivity and 98.23 +/- 1.36 % specificity, outperforming some state-of-the-art classification models based on Transformers and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in the binary classification task of detecting high-risk cervical diseases, including high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) and cervical cancer. Furthermore, ourmodel with the cross-shaped voting strategy achieved a sensitivity of 92.06% and specificity of 95.56% on an external validation dataset containing 288 three-dimensional (3D) OCT volumes from118 Chinese patients in a different new hospital. This result met or exceeded the average of four medical expertswho have used OCT for over one year. In addition to promising classification performance, our model has a remarkable ability to detect and visualize local lesions using the attention map of the standard ViT model, providing good interpretability for gynecologists to locate and diagnose possible cervical diseases."

Presently, there are no validated biomarkers to predict the NACT response, and previous attempts to develop predictive classifiers based on gene expression data have not demonstrated clinical utility. However, predictive models incorporating biological constraints have shown increased robustness and improved performance compared to agnostic classifiers.MethodsWe used the preoperative transcriptomic profiles from 298 patients with TNBC to train and test a rank-based classifier, k-top scoring pairs, to predict whether the patient will have pathological complete response (pCR) or residual disease (RD) following NACT. To reduce overfitting and enhance the signature's interpretability, we constrained the training process to genes involved in the Notch signaling pathway. Subsequently, we evaluated the signature performance on two independent cohorts with 75 and 71 patients. Finally, we assessed the prognostic value of the signature by examining its association with relapse-free survival (RFS) using Kaplan-Meier (KM) survival estimates and a multivariate Cox proportional hazards model.ResultsThe final signature consists of five gene pairs, whose relative ordering can be predictive of the NACT response. The signature has a robust performance at predicting pCR in TNBC patients with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.76 and 0.85 in the first and second testing cohorts, respectively, outperforming other gene signatures developed for the same purpose. Additionally, the signature was significantly associated with RFS in an independent TNBC patient cohort even after adjusting for T stage, patient age at the time of diagnosis, type of breast surgery, and menopausal status.ConclusionWe introduce a robust gene signature to predict pathological complete response (pCR) in patients with TNBC. This signature applies easily interpretable, rank-based decision rules to genes regulated by the Notch signaling pathway, a known determinant in breast cancer chemoresistance. The robust predictive and prognostic performance of the signature make it a strong candidate for clinical implementation, aiding in the stratification of TNBC patients undergoing NACT."

DNA methylation patterns regulate gene expression and have been widely researched. While tools for DNA methylation analysis have been developed, most of them have focused on intergroup comparative analysis within a dataset; therefore, it is difficult to conduct cross-dataset studies, such as rare disease studies or cross-institutional studies. This study describes a novel method for DNA methylation analysis, namely, methPLIER, which enables interdataset comparative analyses. methPLIER combines Pathway Level Information Extractor (PLIER), which is a non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) method, with regularization by a knowledge matrix and transfer learning. methPLIER can be used to perform intersample and interdataset comparative analysis based on latent feature matrices, which are obtained via matrix factorization of large-scale data, and factor-loading matrices, which are obtained through matrix factorization of the data to be analyzed. We used methPLIER to analyze a lung cancer dataset and confirmed that the data decomposition reflected sample characteristics for recurrence-free survival. Moreover, methPLIER can analyze data obtained via different preprocessing methods, thereby reducing distributional bias among datasets due to preprocessing. Furthermore, methPLIER can be employed for comparative analyses of methylation data obtained from different platforms, thereby reducing bias in data distribution due to platform differences. methPLIER is expected to facilitate cross-sectional DNA methylation data analysis and enhance DNA methylation data resources. DNA methylation is significant in diseases like cancer. However, its full impact on gene activity is not completely understood. This research, led by Ken Takasawa and Ryuji Hamamoto, aimed to create a new method to examine DNA methylation data for better comprehension of its biological relevance. The team utilized a technique named methPLIER, an analysis type that compares various DNA methylation data sets. They examined data from 9,756 cancer samples, focusing on how DNA methylation near gene beginnings might regulate gene activity. The scientists used a unique approach to condense the data and then applied methPLIER to discover patterns that could clarify biological processes. They concluded that this technique could aid in understanding the biological significance of DNA methylation patterns. Looking forward, methPLIER could be crucial for future disease research and might assist in developing new cancer diagnosis and treatment methods.This summary was initially drafted using artificial intelligence, then revised and fact-checked by the author."

The choice between four different types of logical neurons in the second layer and the six different types of neuron activation function that compose the artificial neural network of aggregation are defined in a procedure of generating random pairs of combinations between the two factors. The combination that obtains the maximization of training accuracy is chosen to compose the network and perform the composition of the model structure, whose components can be transferred to readable IF-THEN rules for interpretability purposes. Furthermore, the model is able to adapt its parameters and evolve its structure autonomously with new data samples through self-organized direction-aware data partitioning (SODA). In this context, we also propose a technique to measure the degree of changes of neurons (rules), which could be used for structural active learning purposes (e.g, to request user feedback in the case of significant changes). To compare the proposed approach, binary pattern classification tests were performed, and the results were compared with other models of fuzzy neural networks and neural networks, obtaining satisfactory results with the stochastic definition of elements that compose their architecture comparing the final accuracy of the model when classifying real datasets. The proposed model obtained the best result in 3 of the four synthetic bases evaluated, in addition to the best accuracy results in the classification of patterns in five of the nine evaluated real datasets. It highlights the accuracy in problems in patients who underwent breast cancer surgery (72.44%), diabetes evaluation (67.87%), Australian (72.27%) and German (80.51%) credit ratings evaluation, and finally in the classification of radar signals in the ionosphere (90.46%). It is also noteworthy to obtain fuzzy rules in evolution extracted from a real problem of the identification of respiratory diseases through the collection of saliva with 76.67% of accuracy. The results presented by the model were superior to traditional artificial intelligence models, while it was possible to extract knowledge in form of interpretable rules and to realize how these changed over time.

J	"Horiguchi, M; Hassett, MJ; Uno, H"				"Horiguchi, Miki; Hassett, Michael J.; Uno, Hajime"			Empirical power comparison of statistical tests in contemporary phase III randomized controlled trials with time-to-event outcomes in oncology	CLINICAL TRIALS			English	Article						Hazard ratio; log-rank test; restricted mean survival time; survival data analysis; weighted log-rank test	GOODNESS-OF-FIT; MEAN SURVIVAL-TIME; HAZARD RATIOS; MODEL	"Background: More than 95% of recent cancer randomized controlled trials used the log-rank test to detect a treatment difference making it the predominant tool for comparing two survival functions. As with other tests, the log-rank test has both advantages and disadvantages. One advantage is that it offers the highest power against proportional hazards differences, which may be a major reason why alternative methods have rarely been employed in practice. The performance of statistical tests has traditionally been investigated both theoretically and numerically for several patterns of difference between two survival functions. However, to the best of our knowledge, there has been no attempt to compare the performance of various statistical tests using empirical data from past oncology randomized controlled trials. So, it is unknown whether the log-rank test offers a meaningful power advantage over alternative testing methods in contemporary cancer randomized controlled trials. Focusing on recently reported phase III cancer randomized controlled trials, we assessed whether the log-rank test gave meaningfully greater power when compared with five alternative testing methods: generalized Wilcoxon, test based on maximum of test statistics from multiple weighted log-rank tests, difference int-year event rate, and difference in restricted mean survival time with fixed and adaptive tau. Methods: Using manuscripts from cancer randomized controlled trials recently published in high-tier clinical journals, we reconstructed patient-level data for overall survival (69 trials) and progression-free survival (54 trials). For each trial endpoint, we estimated the empirical power of each test. Empirical power was measured as the proportion of trials for which a test would have identified a significant result (pvalue < .05). Results: For overall survival,t-year event rate offered the lowest (30.4%) empirical power and restricted mean survival time with fixed tau offered the highest (43.5%). The empirical power of the other types of tests was almost identical (36.2%-37.7%). For progression-free survival, the tests we investigated offered numerically equivalent empirical power (55.6%-61.1%). No single test consistently outperformed any other test. Conclusion: The empirical power assessment with the past cancer randomized controlled trials provided new insights on the performance of statistical tests. Although the log-rank test has been used in almost all trials, our study suggests that the log-rank test is not the only option from an empirical power perspective. Near universal use of the log-rank test is not supported by a meaningful difference in empirical power. Clinical trial investigators could consider alternative methods, beyond the log-rank test, for their primary analysis when designing a cancer randomized controlled trial. Factors other than power (e.g. interpretability of the estimated treatment effect) should garner greater consideration when selecting statistical tests for cancer randomized controlled trials."

Machine learning did not beat logistic regression in time series prediction for severe asthma exacerbations	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							TRADE-OFF; MODELS; INTERPRETABILITY; PROBABILITY; ACCURACY; CANCER	"Early detection of severe asthma exacerbations through home monitoring data in patients with stable mild-to-moderate chronic asthma could help to timely adjust medication. We evaluated the potential of machine learning methods compared to a clinical rule and logistic regression to predict severe exacerbations. We used daily home monitoring data from two studies in asthma patients (development: n = 165 and validation: n = 101 patients). Two ML models (XGBoost, one class SVM) and a logistic regression model provided predictions based on peak expiratory flow and asthma symptoms. These models were compared with an asthma action plan rule. Severe exacerbations occurred in 0.2% of all daily measurements in the development (154/92,787 days) and validation cohorts (94/40,185 days). The AUC of the best performing XGBoost was 0.85 (0.82-0.87) and 0.88 (0.86-0.90) for logistic regression in the validation cohort. The XGBoost model provided overly extreme risk estimates, whereas the logistic regression underestimated predicted risks. Sensitivity and specificity were better overall for XGBoost and logistic regression compared to one class SVM and the clinical rule. We conclude that ML models did not beat logistic regression in predicting short-term severe asthma exacerbations based on home monitoring data. Clinical application remains challenging in settings with low event incidence and high false alarm rates with high sensitivity."	"[de Hond, Anne A. H.; Kant, Ilse M.

Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying tumor progression is of great clinical significance. This study aims to identify novel molecular markers associated with LUAD subtypes, with the goal of improving the precision of LUAD subtype classification. Additionally, optimization efforts are directed towards enhancing insights from the perspective of patient survival analysis. Materials and methods: We propose an innovative feature-selection approach that focuses on LUAD classification, which is comprehensive and robust. The proposed method integrates multi-omics data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and leverages a synergistic combination of max-relevance and min-redundancy, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator, and Boruta algorithms. These selected features were deployed in six machinelearning classifiers: logistic regression, random forest, support vector machine, naive Bayes, k-Nearest Neighbor, and XGBoost. Results: The proposed approach achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.9958 for LR. Notably, the accuracy and AUC of a composite model incorporating copy number, methylation, as well as RNA- sequencing data for expression of exons, genes, and miRNA mature strands surpassed the accuracy and AUC metrics of models with single-omics data or other multi-omics combinations. Survival analyses, revealed the SVM classifier to elicit optimal classification, outperforming that achieved by TCGA. To enhance model interpretability, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values were utilized to elucidate the impact of each feature on the predictions. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis identified significant biological processes, molecular functions, and cellular components associated with LUAD subtypes. Conclusion: In summary, our feature selection process, based on TCGA multi-omics data and combined with multiple machine learning classifiers, proficiently identifies molecular subtypes of lung adenocarcinoma and their corresponding significant genes. Our method could enhance the early detection and diagnosis of LUAD, expedite the development of targeted therapies and, ultimately, lengthen patient survival."

However, this system requires modification to incorporate modern imaging techniques and new methods for quantifying bone marrow disease that were not previously widely available. The National Cancer Institute sponsored a clinical trials planning meeting in 2012 to update and refine response criteria for patients with neuroblastoma. Methods Multidisciplinary investigators from 13 countries reviewed data from published trials performed through cooperative groups, consortia, and single institutions. Data from both prospective and retrospective trials were used to refine the INRC. Monthly international conference calls were held from 2011 to 2015, and consensus was reached through review by working group leadership and the National Cancer Institute Clinical Trials Planning Meeting leadership council. Results Overall response in the revised INRC will integrate tumor response in the primary tumor, soft tissue and bone metastases, and bone marrow. Primary and metastatic soft tissue sites will be assessed using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) and iodine-123 (I-123)-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scans or [F-18] fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography scans if the tumor is MIBG nonavid. I-123-MIBG scans, or [F-18] fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography scans for MIBG-nonavid disease, replace technetium-99m diphosphonate bone scintigraphy for osteomedullary metastasis assessment. Bone marrow will be assessed by histology or immunohistochemistry and cytology or immunocytology. Bone marrow with <= 5% tumor involvement will be classified as minimal disease. Urinary catecholamine levels will not be included in response assessment. Overall response will be defined as complete response, partial response, minor response, stable disease, or progressive disease. Conclusion These revised criteria will provide a uniform assessment of disease response, improve the interpretability of clinical trial results, and facilitate collaborative trial designs.

Improved multiclass feature selection via list combination	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Feature selection; Multiclass problems; Support vector machine	SAMPLE-FEATURE MACHINE; CLASS DISCOVERY; GENE SELECTION; CANCER; CLASSIFICATION; PREDICTION; PROFILE; MS	"Feature selection is a crucial machine learning technique aimed at reducing the dimensionality of the input space. By discarding useless or redundant variables, not only it improves model performance but also facilitates its interpretability. The well-known Support Vector Machines-Recursive Feature Elimination (SVM-RFE) algorithm provides good performance with moderate computational efforts, in particular for wide datasets. When using SVM-RFE on a multiclass classification problem, the usual strategy is to decompose it into a series of binary ones, and to generate an importance statistics for each feature on each binary problem. These importances are then averaged over the set of binary problems to synthesize a single value for feature ranking. In some cases, however, this procedure can lead to poor selection. In this paper we discuss six new strategies, based on list combination, designed to yield improved selections starting from the importances given by the binary problems. We evaluate them on artificial and real-world datasets, using both One-Vs-One (OVO) and One-Vs-All (OVA) strategies. Our results suggest that the OVO decomposition is most effective for feature selection on multiclass problems. We also find that in most situations the new K-First strategy can find better subsets of features than the traditional weight average approach. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

In previous studies, the powerful network propagation methods have been applied to finding marker genes related to specific diseases, but existing methods are mostly based on a single network, which may be greatly affected by the incompleteness of the network and the ignorance of a large amount of information about physical and functional interactions between biological components. Other methods that directly integrate multiple types of interactions into an aggregate network have the risks that different types of data may conflict with each other and the characteristics and topologies of each individual network are lost. Meanwhile, biomarkers used in clinical trials should have the characteristics of small quantity and strong discriminate ability. In this study, we developed a multiplex network-based dual ranking framework (DualRank) for heterogeneous complex disease analysis. We applied the proposed method to heterogeneous complex diseases for diagnosis, prognosis, and classification. The results showed that DualRank outperformed competing methods and could identify biomarkers with the small quantity, great prediction performance (average AUC = 0.818) and biological interpretability."

This represented a key hurdle for deploying neural networks in many biomedical applications that require interpretability, including predictive genomics. In this paper, linearizing neural network architecture (LINA) was developed here to provide both the first-order and the second-order interpretations on both the instance-wise and the model-wise levels. LINA combines the representational capacity of a deep inner attention neural network with a linearized intermediate representation for model interpretation. In comparison with DeepLIFT, LIME, Grad*Input and L2X, the first-order interpretation of LINA had better Spearman correlation with the ground-truth importance rankings of features in synthetic datasets. In comparison with NID and GEH, the second-order interpretation results from LINA achieved better precision for identification of the ground-truth feature interactions in synthetic datasets. These algorithms were further benchmarked using predictive genomics as a real-world application. LINA identified larger numbers of important single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and salient SNP interactions than the other algorithms at given false discovery rates. The results showed accurate and versatile model interpretation using LINA."

Our method, named pseudo-value regression trees (PRT), is based on the pseudo-value regression framework, modeling individual-specific survival probabilities by computing pseudo-values and relating them to a set of covariates. The standard approach to pseudo-value regression is to fit a main-effects model using generalized estimating equations (GEE). PRT extend this approach by building a multivariate regression tree with pseudo-value outcome and by successively fitting a set of regularized additive models to the data in the nodes of the tree. Due to the combination of tree learning and additive modeling, PRT are able to perform variable selection and to identify relevant interactions between the covariates, thereby addressing several limitations of the standard GEE approach. In addition, PRT include time-dependent effects in the node-wise models. Interpretability of the PRT fits is ensured by controlling the tree depth.

Aggregated Molecular Phenotype Scores: Enhancing Assessment and Visualization of Mass Spectrometry Imaging Data for Tissue-Based Diagnostics	ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article; Early Access							BREAST-CANCER; IDENTIFICATION; TECHNOLOGIES; REGRESSION; PROTEOMICS; MARGINS; PACKAGE; TOF	"Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) has gained increasingpopularityfor tissue-based diagnostics due to its ability to identify and visualizemolecular characteristics unique to different phenotypes within heterogeneoussamples. Data from MSI experiments are often assessed and visualizedusing various supervised and unsupervised statistical approaches.However, these approaches tend to fall short in identifying and conciselyvisualizing subtle, phenotype-relevant molecular changes. To addressthese shortcomings, we developed aggregated molecular phenotype (AMP)scores. AMP scores are generated using an ensemble machine learningapproach to first select features differentiating phenotypes, weightthe features using logistic regression, and combine the weights andfeature abundances. AMP scores are then scaled between 0 and 1, withlower values generally corresponding to class 1 phenotypes (typicallycontrol) and higher scores relating to class 2 phenotypes. AMP scores,therefore, allow the evaluation of multiple features simultaneouslyand showcase the degree to which these features correlate with variousphenotypes. Due to the ensembled approach, AMP scores are able toovercome limitations associated with individual models, leading tohigh diagnostic accuracy and interpretability. Here, AMP score performancewas evaluated using metabolomic data collected from desorption electrosprayionization MSI. Initial comparisons of cancerous human tissues totheir normal or benign counterparts illustrated that AMP scores distinguishedphenotypes with high accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. Furthermore,when combined with spatial coordinates, AMP scores allow visualizationof tissue sections in one map with distinguished phenotypic borders,highlighting their diagnostic utility."

Zoish uniquely addresses these issues by employing Shapley additive values-an idea rooted in cooperative game theory-to enable both transparent and automated feature selection. Unlike existing tools, Zoish is versatile, designed to seamlessly integrate with an array of machine learning libraries including scikit-learn, XGBoost, CatBoost, and imbalanced-learn. The distinct advantage of Zoish lies in its dual algorithmic approach for calculating Shapley values, allowing it to efficiently manage both large and small datasets. This adaptability renders it exceptionally suitable for a wide spectrum of healthcare-related tasks. The tool also places a strong emphasis on interpretability, providing comprehensive visualizations for analyzed features. Its customizable settings offer users fine-grained control over feature selection, thus optimizing for specific predictive objectives. This manuscript elucidates the mathematical framework underpinning Zoish and how it uniquely combines local and global feature selection into a single, streamlined process. To validate Zoish's efficiency and adaptability, we present case studies in breast cancer prediction and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) prediction in Parkinson's disease, along with evaluations on 300 synthetic datasets. These applications underscore Zoish's unparalleled performance in diverse healthcare contexts and against its counterparts."

However, a common issue with unsupervised clustering models is that the optimization direction of the objective function and the final generated clustering labels in the absence of supervised information may be inconsistent or even arbitrary. To address this challenge, a dynamic ensemble pruning framework (DEPF) is proposed to identify and interpret single-cell molecular heterogeneity. In particular, a silhouette coefficient-based indicator is developed to determine the optimization direction of the bi-objective function. In addition, a hierarchical autoencoder is employed to project the high-dimensional data onto multiple low-dimensional latent space sets, and then a clustering ensemble is produced in the latent space by the basic clustering algorithm. Following that, a bi-objective fruit fly optimization algorithm is designed to prune dynamically the low-quality basic clustering in the ensemble. Multiple experiments are conducted on 28 real scRNA-seq datasets and one large real scRNA-seq dataset from diverse platforms and species to validate the effectiveness of the DEPF. In addition, biological interpretability and transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulatory are conducted to explore biological patterns from the cell types identified, which could provide novel insights into characterizing the mechanisms."

It is known that the success of AI is mostly attributed to the availability of big data with annotations for a single task and the advances in high-performance computing. However, medical imaging presents unique challenges that confront DL approaches. In this survey article, we first present traits of medical imaging, highlight both clinical needs and technical challenges in medical imaging, and describe how emerging trends in DL are addressing these issues. We cover the topics of network architecture, sparse and noisy labels, federating learning, interpretability, uncertainty quantification, and so on. Then, we present several case studies that are commonly found in clinical practice, including digital pathology and chest, brain, cardiovascular, and abdominal imaging. Rather than presenting an exhaustive literature survey, we instead describe some prominent research highlights related to these case study applications. We conclude with a discussion and presentation of promising future directions."	"[Zhou, S. Kevin] Univ Sci & Technol China, Sch Biomed Engn, Hefei 230052, Peoples R China; [Zhou, S.

Regularization is often employed to ensure the sparsity and smoothness of the coefficients in logistic regression. However, currently available methods fail to embed the network connectivity in regularized penalty functions. In this paper, a connected network-regularized logistic regression (CNet-RLR) model for feature selection considering the structural connectivity in a network was proposed. Mathematically, it was a convex optimization problem constrained by inequalities reflecting network connectivity. Considering the non-differentiability of Lasso penalty, we constructed an equivalent formulation of CNet-RLR by employing auxiliary variables. An interior-point algorithm was designed to efficiently achieve the solutions. Theoretically, we proved their grouping effect and oracle property and guaranteed algorithmic convergence. In both synthetic simulation data and real-world uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC) cancer genomics data, we validated the CNet-RLR model is efficient to identify the connected-network-structured features that can serve as diagnostic biomarkers. In the comparison study, we also proved the proposed CNet-RLR model results in better classification performance and feature interpretability than the other regularized logistic regression (RLR) alternatives and another graph embedded feature selection model."

In the last 20 years many authors presented a number of techniques showing how to extract symbolic rules from Multi Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). Nevertheless, very few were related to ensembles of neural networks and even less for networks trained by deep learning. On several datasets we performed rule extraction from ensembles of Discretized Interpretable Multi Layer Perceptrons (DIMLP), and DIMLPs trained by deep learning. The results obtained on the Thyroid dataset and the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset show that the predictive accuracy of the extracted rules compare very favorably with respect to state of the art results. Finally, in the last classification problem on digit recognition, generated rules from the MNIST dataset can be viewed as discriminatory features in particular digit areas. Qualitatively, with respect to rule complexity in terms of number of generated rules and number of antecedents per rule, deep DIMLPs and DIMLPs trained by arcing give similar results on a binary classification problem involving digits 5 and 8. On the whole MNIST problem we showed that it is possible to determine the feature detectors created by neural networks and also that the complexity of the extracted rulesets can be well balanced between accuracy and interpretability."

High-dimensional data bring great challenges in terms of computational complexity and classification performance. Therefore, it is necessary to effectively compress in a low-dimensional feature space from high dimensional feature space to design a learner with good performance. Feature extraction has a stronger ability to extract structure information in variables. Feature selection preserves the original features so that obtained feature subset has better explanatory ability. Therefore, dimension reduction is essential to study and understand the mechanism of practical problems of the microarray data. Dimension reduction is the important term which is majorly used in the big areas of genetics, medical and bioinformatics field. In medical applications for high dimensional cancer microarray data the dimension reduction is the important step. In this paper, a new Maximal Information-based Nonparametric Exploration method is proposed for the dimension reduction of the microarray data. In MINE method the MIC ( Maximal Information Coefficient) plays the important role to show the relation between the data. The paper focused on improving the performance in terms of recognition accuracy, relevance, interpretability and redundancy, after comparing the performance of MINE method and Total PLS algorithm on data."

CXRs can aid in diagnosing many lung ailments such as Pneumonia, Tuberculosis, Pneumoconiosis, COVID-19, and lung cancer. Apart from other radiological examinations, every year, 2 billion CXRs are performed worldwide. However, the availability of the workforce to handle this amount of workload in hospitals is cumbersome, particularly in developing and low-income nations. Recent advances in AI, particularly in computer vision, have drawn attention to solving challenging medical image analysis problems. Healthcare is one of the areas where AI/ML-based assistive screening/diagnostic aid can play a crucial part in social welfare. However, it faces multiple challenges, such as small sample space, data privacy, poor quality samples, adversarial attacks and most importantly, the model interpretability for reliability on machine intelligence. This paper provides a structured review of the CXR-based analysis for different tasks, lung diseases and, in particular, the challenges faced by AI/ML-based systems for diagnosis.

Following the recent clamor for brief assessment tools, and taking into account that demoralization has proved to be a symptom that needs to be controlled and treated in the palliative care setting, a shorter scale is needed. The aim of the present research is to introduce and evaluate the Short Demoralization Scale (SDS). Method:We employed a cross-sectional design that included a survey of 226 Spanish palliative care patients from the Hospital General Universitario de Valencia. We employed the SDS, the DS, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Results:The confirmatory factor analysis supported the one-factor structure of the SDS (chi(2)(5) = 12.915; p = 0.024; CFI = 0.999; RMSEA = 0.084; CI95% = [0.028, 0.141]). The reliability was found to be appropriate, with a value of Cronbach's alpha (alpha) equal to 0.920. A cutoff criterion of 10 was established, which favored the interpretability of the instrument. Significance of results:The SDS corrects previous limitations, has a simple scoring system, is cost-effective, and is widely and fully available. In addition, our findings demonstrate that the SDS can be employed effectively in the clinical context."

Gliomas, being among the most common types of CNS tumors, have distinct clinical outcomes and treatment strategies based on different tumor grades, isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation, and 1p/19q codeletion statuses. This paper uses radiomics models to noninvasively predict the glioma subtype with clinical Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) images. Different settings in the radiomics pipeline were investigated to achieve optimal performance, together with a better understanding of the exact role of each setting in the model performance. The characteristics of the radiomic features that best distinguish the glioma subtypes were also analyzed. This paper not only provides a radiomics pipeline which works well for predicting the glioma subtype, but it also contributes to the radiomics model development and interpretability. Gliomas are among the most common types of central nervous system (CNS) tumors. A prompt diagnosis of the glioma subtype is crucial to estimate the prognosis and personalize the treatment strategy. The objective of this study was to develop a radiomics pipeline based on the clinical Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans to noninvasively predict the glioma subtype, as defined based on the tumor grade, isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation status, and 1p/19q codeletion status. A total of 212 patients from the public retrospective The Cancer Genome Atlas Low Grade Glioma (TCGA-LGG) and The Cancer Genome Atlas Glioblastoma Multiforme (TCGA-GBM) datasets were used for the experiments and analyses. Different settings in the radiomics pipeline were investigated to improve the classification, including the Z-score normalization, the feature extraction strategy, the image filter applied to the MRI images, the introduction of clinical information, ComBat harmonization, the classifier chain strategy, etc. Based on numerous experiments, we finally reached an optimal pipeline for classifying the glioma tumors. We then tested this final radiomics pipeline on the hold-out test data with 51 randomly sampled random seeds for reliable and robust conclusions. The results showed that, after tuning the radiomics pipeline, the mean AUC improved from 0.8935 (+/- 0.0351) to 0.9319 (+/- 0.0386), from 0.8676 (+/- 0.0421) to 0.9283 (+/- 0.0333), and from 0.6473 (+/- 0.1074) to 0.8196 (+/- 0.0702) in the test data for predicting the tumor grade, IDH mutation, and 1p/19q codeletion status, respectively. The mean accuracy for predicting the five glioma subtypes also improved from 0.5772 (+/- 0.0816) to 0.6716 (+/- 0.0655). Finally, we analyzed the characteristics of the radiomic features that best distinguished the glioma grade, the IDH mutation, and the 1p/19q codeletion status, respectively. Apart from the promising prediction of the glioma subtype, this study also provides a better understanding of the radiomics model development and interpretability.

It uses an interpretable student model to mimic the predictions made by the black box teacher model. However, when the student model is sensitive to the variability of the data sets used for training even when keeping the teacher fixed, the corresponded interpretation is not reliable. Existing strategies stabilize model distillation by checking whether a large enough sample of pseudo-data is generated to reliably reproduce student models, but methods to do so have so far been developed separately for each specific class of student model. In this paper, we develop a generic approach for stable model distillation based on central limit theorem for the estimated fidelity of the student to the teacher. We start with a collection of candidate student models and search for candidates that reasonably agree with the teacher. Then we construct a multiple testing framework to select a sample size such that the consistent student model would be selected under different pseudo samples. We demonstrate the application of our proposed approach on three commonly used intelligible models: decision trees, falling rule lists and symbolic regression. Finally, we conduct simulation experiments on Mammographic Mass and Breast Cancer datasets and illustrate the testing procedure throughout a theoretical analysis with Markov process.

The use of whole metabolome profiles is a promising strategy for disease diagnosis but technically challenging. Here, we developed an approach, namely MetImage, to encode LC-MS-based untargeted metabolomics data into multi-channel digital images. Then, the images that represent the comprehensive metabolome profiles can be employed for developing deep learning-based AI models toward clinical diagnosis. In this work, we demonstrated the application of MetImage for clinical screening of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) in a clinical cohort with 1104 participants. A convolutional neuronal network-based AI model was trained to distinguish ESCC screening positive and negative subjects using their serum metabolomics data. Superior performances such as sensitivity (85%), specificity (92%), and area under curve (0.95) were validated in an independent testing cohort (N = 442). Importantly, we demonstrated that our AI-based ESCC screening model is not a black box. The encoded images reserved the characteristics of mass spectra from the raw LC-MS data; therefore, metabolite identifications in key image features were readily achieved. Altogether, MetImage is a unique approach that encodes raw LC-MS-based untargeted metabolomics data into images and facilitates the utilization of whole metabolome profiles for AI-based clinical applications with improved interpretability."

Continuous effort has been made at finding effective strategies to interpret these types of models, among them saliency maps, which depict the weights of the pixels on the classification as an heatmap of intensity values, have been by far the most used for image classification. However, there is a lack of tools for the systematic evaluation of saliency maps, and existing works introduce non-natural noise such as random or uniform values. To address this issue, we propose an approach to evaluate the faithfulness of the saliency maps by introducing natural perturbations in the image, based on oppose-class substitution, and studying their impact on evaluation metrics adapted from saliency models. We validate the proposed approach on a breast cancer metastases detection dataset PatchCamelyon with 327,680 patches of histopathological images of sentinel lymph node sections. Results show that GradCAM, Guided-GradCAM and gradient-based saliency map methods are sensitive to natural perturbations and correlate to the presence of tumor evidence in the image. Overall, this approach proves to be a solution for the validation of saliency map methods without introducing confounding variables and shows potential for application on other medical imaging tasks."

Diverse sets of computational tools have been developed for omics data reduction and protein selection. However, standard statistical models with single-feature selection involve the multi-testing burden of low power with limited available samples. Furthermore, high correlations among proteins with high redundancy and moderate effects often lead to unstable selections and cause reproducibility issues. Ensemble feature selection in machine learning (ML) may identify a stable set of disease biomarkers that could improve the prediction performance of subsequent classification models and thereby simplify their interpretability. In this study, we developed a three-stage homogeneous ensemble feature selection (HEFS) approach for both identifying proteins and improving prediction accuracy. This approach was implemented and applied to ovarian cancer proteogenomics datasets comprising (1) binary putative homologous recombination deficiency (HRD)- positive or -negative samples; (2) multiple mRNA classes (differentiated, proliferative, immunoreactive, mesenchymal, and unknown samples). We conducted and compared various ML methods with HEFS including random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and neural network (NN) for predicting both binary and multiple-class outcomes. The results indicated that the prediction accuracies varied for both binary and multiple-class classifications using various ML approaches with the proposed HEFS method. RF and NN provided better prediction accuracies than simple Naive Bayes or logistic models. For binary outcomes, with a sample size of 122 and nine selected prediction proteins using our proposed three-stage HEFS approach, the best ensemble ML (Treebag) achieved 83% accuracy, 85% sensitivity, and 81% specificity. For multiple (five)-class outcomes, the proposed HEFS-selected proteins combined with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in NN resulted in prediction accuracies for multiple-class classifications ranging from 75% to 96% for each of the five classes. Despite the different prediction accuracies of the various models, HEFS identified consistent sets of proteins linked to the binary and multiple-class outcomes."

They usually show similar imaging patterns and are highly demanded to differentiate for precision diagnosis and treatment planning. The objective of this study is therefore to construct a novel deep-learning-based method for effective differentiation of two diseases, with the comparative study of traditional radiomics analysis. MethodsWe retrospectively enrolled a total of 217 patients with 269 lesions, who were diagnosed with spinal MM (79 cases, 81 lesions) or spinal metastases originated from lung cancer (138 cases, 188 lesions) confirmed by postoperative pathology. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences of all patients were collected and reviewed. A novel deep learning model of the Multi-view Attention-Guided Network (MAGN) was constructed based on contrast-enhanced T1WI (CET1) sequences. The constructed model extracts features from three views (sagittal, coronal and axial) and fused them for a more comprehensive differentiation analysis, and the attention guidance strategy is adopted for improving the classification performance, and increasing the interpretability of the method. The diagnostic efficiency among MAGN, radiomics model and the radiologist assessment were compared by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). ResultsAblation studies were conducted to demonstrate the validity of multi-view fusion and attention guidance strategies: It has shown that the diagnostic model using multi-view fusion achieved higher diagnostic performance [ACC (0.79), AUC (0.77) and F1-score (0.67)] than those using single-view (sagittal, axial and coronal) images. Besides, MAGN incorporating attention guidance strategy further boosted performance as the ACC, AUC and F1-scores reached 0.81, 0.78 and 0.71, respectively. In addition, the MAGN outperforms the radiomics methods and radiologist assessment. The highest ACC, AUC and F1-score for the latter two methods were 0.71, 0.76 & 0.54, and 0.69, 0.71, & 0.65, respectively. ConclusionsThe proposed MAGN can achieve satisfactory performance in differentiating spinal MM between metastases originating from lung cancer, which also outperforms the radiomics method and radiologist assessment."

Vaccine design targeting MHC generally aims to find epitopes with a high binding affinity for MHC presentation. Nevertheless, to find novel epitopes usually requires high-throughput screening of bulk peptide database, which is time-consuming, labor-intensive, more unaffordable, and very expensive. Excitingly, the past several years have witnessed the great success of artificial intelligence (AI) in various fields, such as natural language processing (NLP, e.g., GPT-4), protein structure prediction and engineering (e.g., AlphaFold2), and so on. Therefore, herein, we propose a deep reinforcement-learning (RL)-based generative algorithm, RLpMIEC, to quantitatively design peptide targeting MHC-I systems. Specifically, RLpMIEC combines the energetic spectrum (namely, the molecular interaction energy component, MIEC) based on the peptide-MHC interaction and the sequence information to generate peptides with strong binding affinity and precise MIEC spectra to accelerate the discovery of candidate peptide vaccines. RLpMIEC performs well in all the generative capability evaluations and can generate peptides with strong binding affinities and precise MIECs and, moreover, with high interpretability, demonstrating its powerful capability in participation for accelerating peptide-based vaccine development."

The increasing deployment of opaque AI applications in highstakes fields, particularly healthcare, has amplified the need for clarity and explainability. This stems from the potential high -impact consequences of erroneous AI predictions in such critical sectors. The effective integration of AI models in healthcare hinges on the capacity of these models to be both explainable and interpretable. Gaining the trust of healthcare professionals necessitates AI applications to be transparent about their decision -making processes and underlying logic. Our paper conducts a systematic review of the various facets and challenges of XAI within the healthcare realm. It aims to dissect a range of XAI methodologies and their applications in healthcare, categorizing them into six distinct groups: feature -oriented methods, global methods, concept models, surrogate models, local pixel -based methods, and human -centric approaches. Specifically, this study focuses on the significance of XAI in addressing healthcarerelated challenges, underscoring its vital role in safety -critical scenarios. Our objective is to provide an exhaustive exploration of XAI's applications in healthcare, alongside an analysis of relevant experimental outcomes, thereby fostering a holistic understanding of XAI's role and potential in this critical domain."

We seek to develop a machine learning-based neutropenia prediction model that can be used to assess risk at the initiation of a chemotherapy cycle. MATERIALS AND METHODS We leverage rich electronic medical records (EMRs) data from a large health care system and apply machine learning methods to predict severe and febrile neutropenic events. We outline the data curation process and challenges posed by EMRs data. We explore a range of algorithms with an emphasis on model interpretability and ease of use in a clinical setting. RESULTS Our final proposed model demonstrates an out-of-sample area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.865 (95% CI, 0.830 to 0.891) in the prediction of neutropenic events on the basis of only 20 clinical features. The model validates known risk factors and offers insight into potential novel clinical indicators and treatment characteristics that elevate risk. It relies on factors that are directly extractable from EMRs, provided a tool can be easily integrated into existing workflows. A cost-based analysis provides insight into optimal risk thresholds and offers a framework for tailoring algorithms to individual hospital needs.

Predicting antibody binders and generating synthetic antibodies using deep learning	MABS			English	Article						Antibody repertoires; deep learning; machine learning; deep sequencing; convolutional neural networks; generative adversarial networks	IMMUNOGLOBULIN	"The antibody drug field has continually sought improvements to methods for candidate discovery and engineering. Historically, most such methods have been laboratory-based, but informatics methods have recently started to make an impact. Deep learning, a subfield of machine learning, is rapidly gaining prominence in the biomedical research. Recent advances in microfluidics technologies and next-generation sequencing have not only revolutionized therapeutic antibody discovery, but also contributed to a vast amount of antibody repertoire sequencing data, providing opportunities for deep learning-based applications. Previously, we used microfluidics, yeast display, and deep sequencing to generate a panel of binder and non-binder antibody sequences to the cancer immunotherapy targets PD-1 and CTLA-4. Here we encoded the antibody light and heavy chain complementarity-determining regions (CDR3s) into antibody images, then built and trained convolutional neural network models to classify binders and non-binders. To improve model interpretability, we performed in silico mutagenesis to identify CDR3 residues that were important for binder classification. We further built generative deep learning models using generative adversarial network models to produce synthetic antibodies against PD-1 and CTLA-4. Our models generated variable length CDR3 sequences that resemble real sequences. Overall, our study demonstrates that deep learning methods can be leveraged to mine and learn patterns in antibody sequences, offering insights into antibody engineering, optimization, and discovery."

Despite this, current techniques, which can be invasive and costly, struggle with achieving the necessary precision, highlighting a pressing need for more effective, non-invasive alternatives.MethodWe developed ResoLSTM-Depth, a deep learning model to distinguish ESCC stages T1-T2 from T3-T4. It integrates ResNet-18 and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, leveraging their strengths in spatial and sequential data processing. This method uses arterial phase CT scans from ESCC patients. The dataset was meticulously segmented by an experienced radiologist for effective training and validation.ResultsUpon performing five-fold cross-validation, the ResoLSTM-Depth model exhibited commendable performance with an accuracy of 0.857, an AUC of 0.901, a sensitivity of 0.884, and a specificity of 0.828. These results were superior to the ResNet-18 model alone, where the average accuracy is 0.824 and the AUC is 0.879. Attention maps further highlighted influential features for depth prediction, enhancing model interpretability.ConclusionResoLSTM-Depth is a promising tool for ESCC invasion depth prediction.

In the context of glioma prognosis, machine learning (ML) approaches could facilitate the navigation through the maze of factors influencing survival, aiding clinicians in generating more precise and personalized survival predictions. Here we report the utilization of ML models in predicting survival at 12, 24, 36, and 60 months following grade II and III glioma diagnosis. From the National Cancer Database, we analyze 10,001 WHO grade II and 11,456 grade III cranial gliomas. Using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) values, we deploy the top-performing models in a web application for individualized predictions. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) enhance the interpretability of the models. Top-performing predictive models are the ones built with LightGBM and Random Forest algorithms. For grade II gliomas, the models yield AUROC values ranging from 0.813 to 0.896 for predicting mortality across different timeframes, and for grade III gliomas, the models yield AUROCs ranging from 0.855 to 0.878. ML models provide individualized survival forecasts for grade II and III glioma patients across multiple clinically relevant time points.

We present LymphoML - an interpretable machine learning method that identifies morphologic features that correlate with lymphoma subtypes. Our method applies steps to process H&E-stained tissue microarray cores, segment nuclei and cells, compute features encompassing morphology, texture, and architecture, and train gradient-boosted models to make diagnostic predictions. LymphoML's interpretable models, developed on a limited volume of H&E-stained tissue, achieve non-inferior diagnostic accuracy to pathologists using whole-slide images and outperform black box deep-learning on a dataset of 670 cases from Guatemala spanning 8 lymphoma subtypes. Using SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) analysis, we assess the impact of each feature on model prediction and find that nuclear shape features are most discriminative for DLBCL (F1-score: 78.7%) and classical Hodgkin lymphoma (F1-score: 74.5%). Finally, we provide the first demonstration that a model combining features from H&E-stained tissue with features from a standardized panel of 6 immunostains results in a similar diagnostic accuracy (85.3%) to a 46-stain panel (86.1%)."

Foremost among these is the ability of AI to conduct swift and efficient screenings of expansive compound libraries, significantly augmenting the identification of potential drug candidates. Moreover, AI algorithms can prove instrumental in predicting the efficacy and safety profiles of candidate compounds, thus endowing invaluable insights and reducing reliance on extensive preclinical and clinical testing. This predictive capacity of AI has the potential to streamline the drug development pipeline and enhance the success rate of clinical trials, ultimately resulting in the emergence of more efficacious and safer therapeutic agents. However, the deployment of AI in drug discovery introduces certain challenges that warrant attention. A primary hurdle entails the imperative acquisition of high-quality and diverse data. Furthermore, ensuring the interpretability of AI models assumes critical importance in securing regulatory endorsement and cultivating trust within scientific and medical communities. Addressing ethical considerations, including data privacy and mitigating bias, represents an additional momentous challenge, requiring assiduous navigation. In this review, we provide an intricate and comprehensive overview of the multifaceted challenges intrinsic to conventional drug development paradigms, while simultaneously interrogating the efficacy of AI in effectively surmounting these formidable obstacles."

A Social-Discursive Analysis About Non/credibility	SOCIAL EPISTEMOLOGY			English	Article						ME/CFS; credibility deficits; epistemic injustice; discourse analysis	EPISTEMIC INJUSTICE; JUSTICE; CONSTRUCTION; STIGMA; CANCER; VIRTUE; MEDIA	"Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (ME)/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) is a highly contested illness. This paper analyzes the discursive production of knowledge about, and recognition of ME/CFS. By mobilizing insights from social epistemology and epistemic injustice studies, this paper reveals how actors, through their social-discursive practices, attribute to establishing, sustaining, and disregarding their own and others' epistemological position. In focusing on the case of the Dutch newspaper reporting about ME/CFS, this paper shows that the debate about this condition predominantly revolves around the ways in which people who make truth claims are represented. In being portrayed as gendered, affectatious, formerly very able, fanatical, or benevolent, people with ME/CFS are constructed as non-/credible. In the debate about what causes ME/CFS, by contrast, the production of non-/credible knowledge focuses more on the content of epistemic positions. Actors in this debate argue that they know the (clear) causes for the illness, something which functions as a discursive strategy to establish and enhance their credibility. This paper contends, however, that since this discursive demarcation of causes is consistently infused with uncertainty - with multi-interpretability, with diffuse explanations, and absence of current knowledge - the credibility of these actors' epistemic position is undercut rather than established."

The TMGs were utilized to construct and validate a TP53-associated metabolic gene signature (TMS). Comprehensive bioinformatics analyses were performed to explore clinical application value and biological interpretability of TMS.Results: We identified 86 TMGs based on the TP53 mutation status. TMS including CYP26B1, CYP2C9, G6PD, PYGM and TKTL1 was constructed and validated to identify the low-TMSscore group had a better prognosis than the high-TMSscore group. Tryptophan metabolism and fatty acid metabolism were significantly enriched in the low-TMSscore group. Moreover, it was characterized by a higher abundance of gamma delta T cell and natural killer cell than the high-TMSscore group. Compared to the high-TMSscore group, the low-TMSscore group was more likely to respond to immune checkpoint therapy.Conclusions: The TMS is a potential strategy for prognostic prediction and immune checkpoint therapy guidance for HCC patients.

For survival outcomes the Cox proportional hazards model is generally used and it has been proven to achieve good prediction performances with few strong covariates. The possibility to improve the model performance by including nonlinearities, covariate interactions and time-varying effects while controlling for overfitting must be carefully considered during the model building phase. On the other hand, ML techniques are able to learn complexities from data at the cost of hyper-parameter tuning and interpretability. One aspect of special interest is the sample size needed for developing a survival prediction model. While there is guidance when using traditional statistical models, the same does not apply when using ML techniques. This work develops a time-to-event simulation framework to evaluate performances of Cox regression compared, among others, to tuned random survival forest, gradient boosting, and neural networks at varying sample sizes. Simulations were based on replications of subjects from publicly available databases, where event times were simulated according to a Cox model with nonlinearities on continuous variables and time-varying effects and on the SEER registry data."

One of the appealing properties of the Gaussian distribution is that conditional independence can be fully characterized by the sparseness in the precision matrix. The skewed Gaussian distribution adds a shape parameter to the Gaussian distribution to take into account possible skewness in the data; thus it is more flexible than the Gaussian model. Nevertheless, the appealing property of the Gaussian distribution is retained to a large degree: the conditional independence is still characterized by the sparseness in the parameters, which now include a shape parameter in addition to the precision matrix. As a result, the skewed Gaussian graphical model can be efficiently estimated through a penalized likelihood method just as the Gaussian graphical model. We develop an algorithm to maximize the penalized likelihood based on the alternating direction method of multipliers, and establish the asymptotic normality and variable selection consistency for the new estimator. Through simulations, we demonstrate that our method performs better than the Gaussian and Gaussian copula methods when these distributional assumptions are not satisfied. The method is applied to a breast cancer MicroRNA dataset to construct a gene network, which shows better interpretability than the Gaussian graphical model."

In medical imaging, these models have shown human-level performance and even higher in the early diagnosis of a wide range of diseases. However, the goal is often not only to accurately predict group membership or diagnose but also to provide explanations that support the model decision in a context that a human can readily interpret. The limited transparency has hindered the adoption of DNN algorithms across many domains. Numerous explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques have been developed to peer inside the black box  and make sense of DNN models, taking somewhat divergent approaches. Here, we suggest that these methods may be considered in light of the interpretation goal, including functional or mechanistic interpretations, developing archetypal class instances, or assessing the relevance of certain features or mappings on a trained model in a post-hoc capacity. We then focus on reviewing recent applications of post-hoc relevance techniques as applied to neuroimaging data. Moreover, this article suggests a method for comparing the reliability of XAI methods, especially in deep neural networks, along with their advantages and pitfalls."

AUC, the area under the ROC curve, is often used as a gold standard to evaluate the performance of a binary classifier. The existing methods of constructing classifier by optimizing AUC are easy to fall into local optimum, and have high time complexity, which is not suitable for real-time analysis of high-dimensional gene expression data. With the rapid development of high-throughput sequencing technology, feature selection and model estimation become the necessary means to reduce the dimension and complexity of data, and the selected important features have the potential as biomarkers to reveal the pathogenesis of diseases. In this paper, we proposed a topological AUC-based biomarker ensemble method for the complex disease analysis, which uses gene expression data and the topological information derived from the protein-protein interaction network to identify biomarkers. The main contribution is to optimize two objectives simultaneously: maximizing the AUC score and minimizing the number of selected features.

Previous kernel-based machine learning algorithms proposed for increased interpretability started to fail with large sample sizes, owing to their lack of scalability. To overcome this problem, we proposed a fast and efficient multiple kernel learning (MKL) algorithm to be particularly used with large-scale data that integrates kernel approximation and group Lasso formulations into a conjoint model. Our method extracts significant and meaningful information from the genomic data while conjointly learning a model for out-of-sample prediction. It is scalable with increasing sample size by approximating instead of calculating distinct kernel matrices. Results: To test our computational framework, namely, Multiple Approximate Kernel Learning (MAKL), we demonstrated our experiments on three cancer datasets and showed that MAKL is capable to outperform the baseline algorithm while using only a small fraction of the input features. We also reported selection frequencies of approximated kernel matrices associated with feature subsets (i.e. gene sets/pathways), which helps to see their relevance for the given classification task. Our fast and interpretable MKL algorithm producing sparse solutions is promising for computational biology applications considering its scalability and highly correlated structure of genomic datasets, and it can be used to discover new biomarkers and new therapeutic guidelines."

The classification of imbalanced data has remarkable challenges in machine learning. The support vector machine (SVM) and its variants are popularly used in machine learning among different classifiers thanks to their flexibility and interpretability. However, the performance of SVMs is impacted when the data are imbalanced, which is a typical data structure in the multi-category classification problem. In this paper, we employ the data-adaptive SVM with scaled kernel functions to classify instances for a multi-class population. We propose a multi-class data-dependent kernel function for the SVM by considering class imbalance and the spatial association among instances so that the classification accuracy is enhanced. Simulation studies demonstrate the superb performance of the proposed method, and a real multi-class prostate cancer image dataset is employed as an illustration. Not only does the proposed method outperform the competitor methods in terms of the commonly used accuracy measures such as the F-score and G-means, but also successfully detects more than 60% of instances from the rare class in the real data, while the competitors can only detect less than 20% of the rare class instances.

Choosing appropriate transformations for variables can enhance visualization, improve efficacy of analytical methods, and increase data interpretability. However, determining appropriate transformations of variables from high-content imaging data poses new challenges. Imaging data produce hundreds of covariates from each of thousands of images in a corpus. Each of these covariates will have a different distribution and needs a potentially different transformation. As such imaging data produce hundreds of covariates, determining an appropriate transformation for each of them is infeasible by hand. In this article, we explore simple, robust, and automatic transformations of high-content image data. A central application of our work is to microenvironment microarray bio-imaging data from the NIH LINCS program. We show that our robust transformations enhance visualization and improve the discovery of substantively relevant latent effects. These transformations enhance analysis of image features individually and also improve data integration approaches when combining together multiple features. We anticipate that the advantages of this work will likely also be realized in the analysis of data from other high-content and highly multiplexed technologies like Cell Painting or Cyclic Immunofluorescence.

Therefore, comprehending the underlying mechanisms of the receptor functional properties is of particular interest in pharmacoproteomics and in disease therapy at large. Their interaction with ligands elicits multiple molecular rearrangements all along their structure, inducing activation pathways that distinctly influence the cell response. In this work, we studied GPCR signaling pathways from molecular dynamics simulations as they provide rich information about the dynamic nature of the receptors. We focused on studying the molecular properties of the receptors using deep-learning-based methods. In particular, we designed and trained a one-dimensional convolution neural network and illustrated its use in a classification of conformational states: active, intermediate, or inactive, of the beta 2-adrenergic receptor when bound to the full agonist BI-167107. Through a novel explainability-oriented investigation of the prediction results, we were able to identify and assess the contribution of individual motifs (residues) influencing a particular activation pathway.

As a prerequisite, an improved semiautomated matching of patient characteristics with clinical trial eligibility criteria is needed. This is based on the computer interpretability, i.e., structurability of eligibility criteria texts. To increase structurability, the common content, phrasing, and structuring problems of oncological eligibility criteria need to be better understood. Objectives We aimed to identify oncological eligibility criteria that were not possible to be structured by our manual approach and categorize them by the underlying structuring problem. Our results shall contribute to improved criteria phrasing in the future as a prerequisite for increased structurability. Methods The inclusion and exclusion criteria of 159 oncological studies from the Clinical Trial Information System of the National Center for Tumor Diseases Heidelberg were manually structured and grouped into content-related subcategories. Criteria identified as not structurable were analyzed further and manually categorized by the underlying structuring problem. Results The structuring of criteria resulted in 4,742 smallest meaningful components (SMCs) distributed across seven main categories (Diagnosis, Therapy, Laboratory, Study, Findings, Demographics, and Lifestyle, Others). A proportion of 645 SMCs (13.60%) was not possible to be structured due to content- and structure-related issues. Of these, a subset of 415 SMCs (64.34%) was considered not remediable, as supplementary medical knowledge would have been needed or the linkage among the sentence components was too complex. The main category Diagnosis and Study contained these two subcategories to the largest parts and thus were the least structurable. In the inclusion criteria, reasons for lacking structurability varied, while missing supplementary medical knowledge was the largest factor within the exclusion criteria. Conclusion Our results suggest that further improvement of eligibility criterion phrasing only marginally contributes to increased structurability. Instead, physician-based confirmation of the matching results and the exclusion of factors harming the patient or biasing the study is needed."

Given global image labels, WSL methods yield pixel-level predictions (segmentations), which enable to interpret class predictions. Despite their recent success, mostly with natural images, such methods can face important challenges when the foreground and background regions have similar visual cues, yielding high false-positive rates in segmentations, as is the case in challenging histology images. WSL training is commonly driven by standard classification losses, which implicitly maximize model confidence, and locate the discriminative regions linked to classification decisions. Therefore, they lack mechanisms for modeling explicitly non-discriminative regions and reducing false-positive rates. We propose novel regularization terms, which enable the model to seek both non-discriminative and discriminative regions, while discouraging unbalanced segmentations. We introduce high uncertainty as a criterion to localize non-discriminative regions that do not affect classifier decision, and describe it with original Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence losses evaluating the deviation of posterior predictions from the uniform distribution. Our KL terms encourage high uncertainty of the model when the latter inputs the latent non-discriminative regions.

This study aims to establish a model and a convenient online prediction platform to predict whether LSCC patients will survive 5 years after diagnosis, providing a reference for further evaluation of patient prognosis. Methods: This is a retrospective study based on data collected from two centers. Center 1 included 117 LSCC patients with survival prognosis data, and center 2 included 33 patients, totaling 150 patients. All data were divided into independent training sets (60 %) and testing sets (40 %). Eight machine learning (ML) algorithms were used to establish models with 11 clinical parameters as input features. The accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) of the testing set were used to evaluate the models, and the best model was selected. The model was then developed into a website-based 5-year survival status prediction platform for LSCC. In addition, we also used the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) tool to conduct interpretability analysis on the parameters of the model. Results: The LSCC 5-year survival status prediction model using the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm achieved the best results, with accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 85.0 %, 87.5 %, 75.0 %, and 81.2 % respectively. The online platform for predicting the 5-year survival status of LSCC based on this model was successfully established. The SHAP analysis shows that the clinical stage is the most important feature of the model. Conclusion: This study successfully established a ML model and a practical online prediction platform to predict the survival status of laryngeal cancer patients after 5 years, which may help clinicians to better evaluate the prognosis of LSCC.

However, one of the most relevant pitfalls of traditional Polygenic Risk Scores (PRS) approaches is their inability to model complex high-order non-linear SNP-SNP interactions and their effect on the phenotype (e.g. epistasis). Indeed, they incur in a computational challenge as the number of possible interactions grows exponentially with the number of SNPs considered, affecting the statistical reliability of the model parameters as well. In this work, we address this issue by proposing a novel PRS approach, called High-order Interactions-aware Polygenic Risk Score (hiPRS), that incorporates high-order interactions in modeling polygenic risk. The latter combines an interaction search routine based on frequent itemsets mining and a novel interaction selection algorithm based on Mutual Information, to construct a simple and interpretable weighted model of user-specified dimensionality that can predict a given binary phenotype. Compared to traditional PRSs methods, hiPRS does not rely on GWAS summary statistics nor any external information. Moreover, hiPRS differs from Machine Learning-based approaches that can include complex interactions in that it provides a readable and interpretable model and it is able to control overfitting, even on small samples. In the present work we demonstrate through a comprehensive simulation study the superior performance of hiPRS w.r.t. state of the art methods, both in terms of scoring performance and interpretability of the resulting model. We also test hiPRS against small sample size, class imbalance and the presence of noise, showcasing its robustness to extreme experimental settings. Finally, we apply hiPRS to a case study on real data from DACHS cohort, defining an interaction-aware scoring model to predict mortality of stage II-III Colon-Rectal Cancer patients treated with oxaliplatin."

Early identification may direct preventative supportive care, improving outcomes and reducing health care costs. We developed and evaluated a machine learning (ML) approach to predict these events. Methods A total of 8,134 outpatient courses of RT and CRT from a single institution from 2013 to 2016 were identified. Extensive pretreatment data were programmatically extracted and processed from the electronic health record (EHR). Training and internal validation cohorts were randomly generated (3:1 ratio). Gradient tree boosting (GTB), random forest, support vector machine, and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator logistic regression approaches were trained and internally validated based on area under receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve. The most predictive ML approach was also evaluated using only disease- and treatment-related factors to assess predictive gain of extensive EHR data. Results All methods had high predictive accuracy, particularly GTB (validation AUROC, 0.798). Extensive EHR data beyond disease and treatment information improved accuracy (delta AUROC, 0.056). A Youden-based cutoff corresponded to validation sensitivity of 81.0% (175 of 216 courses with events) and specificity of 67.3% (1,218 of 1811 courses without events). Interpretability is an important advantage of GTB. Variable importance identified top predictive factors, including treatment (planned RT and systemic therapy), pretreatment encounters (emergency department visits and admissions in the year before treatment), vital signs (weight loss and pain score in the year before treatment), and laboratory values (albumin level at weeks before treatment). Conclusion ML predicts emergency visits and hospitalization during cancer therapy. Incorporating predictions into clinical care algorithms may help direct personalized supportive care, improve quality of care, and reduce costs. A prospective trial investigating ML-assisted direction of increased clinical assessments during RT is planned.

J	"Baptista, D; Ferreira, PG; Rocha, M"				"Baptista, Delora; Ferreira, Pedro G.; Rocha, Miguel"			A systematic evaluation of deep learning methods for the prediction of drug synergy in cancer	PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY			English	Article							CELL-LINES; KINASE INHIBITOR; LUNG-CANCER; RESISTANCE; PAIRS; MECHANISM; CELLMINER; PLATFORM; MODELS; ZD1839	"Author summaryCancer therapies often fail because tumor cells become resistant to treatment. One way to overcome resistance is by treating patients with a combination of two or more drugs. Some combinations may be more effective than when considering individual drug effects, a phenomenon called drug synergy. Computational drug synergy prediction methods can help to identify new, clinically relevant drug combinations. In this study, we developed several deep learning models for drug synergy prediction. We examined the effect of using different types of deep learning architectures, and different ways of representing drugs and cancer cell lines. We explored the use of biological prior knowledge to select relevant cell line features, and also tested data-driven feature reduction methods. We tested both precomputed drug features and deep learning methods that can directly learn features from raw representations of molecules. We also evaluated whether including genomic features, in addition to gene expression data, improves the predictive performance of the models. Through these experiments, we were able to identify strategies that will help guide the development of new deep learning models for drug synergy prediction in the future. One of the main obstacles to the successful treatment of cancer is the phenomenon of drug resistance. A common strategy to overcome resistance is the use of combination therapies. However, the space of possibilities is huge and efficient search strategies are required. Machine Learning (ML) can be a useful tool for the discovery of novel, clinically relevant anti-cancer drug combinations. In particular, deep learning (DL) has become a popular choice for modeling drug combination effects. Here, we set out to examine the impact of different methodological choices on the performance of multimodal DL-based drug synergy prediction methods, including the use of different input data types, preprocessing steps and model architectures. Focusing on the NCI ALMANAC dataset, we found that feature selection based on prior biological knowledge has a positive impact-limiting gene expression data to cancer or drug response-specific genes improved performance. Drug features appeared to be more predictive of drug response, with a 41% increase in coefficient of determination (R-2) and 26% increase in Spearman correlation relative to a baseline model that used only cell line and drug identifiers. Molecular fingerprint-based drug representations performed slightly better than learned representations-ECFP4 fingerprints increased R-2 by 5.3% and Spearman correlation by 2.8% w.r.t the best learned representations. In general, fully connected feature-encoding subnetworks outperformed other architectures. DL outperformed other ML methods by more than 35% (R-2) and 14% (Spearman). Additionally, an ensemble combining the top DL and ML models improved performance by about 6.5% (R-2) and 4% (Spearman). Using a state-of-the-art interpretability method, we showed that DL models can learn to associate drug and cell line features with drug response in a biologically meaningful way. The strategies explored in this study will help to improve the development of computational methods for the rational design of effective drug combinations for cancer therapy."

Although proteomics has indeed shown great potential in the field of precision medicine, few studies have focused on the computational prediction of protein levels from pathology images. In this paper, we assume that deep learning-based pathological features imply the protein levels of tumor biomarkers that are indicative of prognosis and drug response. For this purpose, we propose wsi2rppa, a weakly supervised contrastive learning framework to infer the protein levels of tumor biomarkers from whole slide images (WSIs) in breast cancer. We first conducted contrastive learning-based pre-training on tessellated tiles to extract pathological features, which are then aggregated by attention pooling and adapted to downstream tasks. We conducted extensive evaluation experiments on the TCGA-BRCA cohort (1978 WSIs of 1093 patients with protein levels of 223 biomarkers) and the CPTAC-BRCA cohort (642 WSIs of 134 patients). The results showed that our method achieved state-of-the-art performance in tumor diagnostic tasks, and also performed well in predicting clinically relevant protein levels and drug response. To show the model interpretability, we spatially visualized the WSIs colored the tiles by their attention scores, and found that the regions with high scores were highly consistent with the tumor and necrotic regions annotated by a 10-year experienced pathologist. Moreover, spatial transcriptomic data further verified that the heatmap generated by attention scores agrees greatly with the spatial expression landscape of two typical tumor biomarker genes. In predicting the response to drug trastuzumab treatment, our method achieved a 0.79 AUC value which is much higher than the previous study reported 0.68. These findings showed the remarkable potential of computational pathology in the prediction of clinically relevant protein levels, drug response, and clinical outcomes."

Multivariable Cox regression provided hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI), adjusted for age, sex, education, calendar year, comorbidity, low-dose aspirin use, tumour sublocation, pathological tumour stage, neoadjuvant chemotherapy, annual surgeon volume, and surgical radicality.ResultsAmong 1515 participating patients, the mean age was 69 years and 58.4% were men. Statin use, identified in 399 (26.3%) patients, was not associated with any statistically significantly decreased 5-year disease-specific mortality (HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.82-1.21) or 5-year all-cause mortality (HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.79-1.12). No risk reductions were found across subgroups of age, sex, aspirin user status, or tumour stage, or in patients with long-term preoperative of postoperative use of statins, all with point estimates close to 1.ConclusionsPerioperative use of statins does not seem to improve the 5-year survival in patients who undergo gastrectomy with curative intent for gastric adenocarcinoma in Sweden."

Our group developed evidence-based training specifically addressing PRO components of protocols. We aimed to assess whether 2-day educational workshops improved the PRO completeness of protocols against consensus-based minimum standards provided in the SPIRIT-PRO Extension in 2018. Method Annual workshops were conducted 2011-2017. Participants were investigators/trialists from cancer clinical trials groups. Although developed before 2018, workshops covered 15/16 SPIRIT-PRO items. Participant feedback immediately post-workshop and, retrospectively, in November 2017 was summarised descriptively. Protocols were evaluated against SPIRIT-PRO by two independent raters for workshop protocols (developed post-workshop by participants) and control protocols (contemporaneous non-workshop protocols). SPIRIT-PRO items were assessed for completeness (0 = not addressed, 10 = fully addressed). Mann-Whitney U tests assessed whether workshop protocols scored higher than controls by item and overall. Results Participants (n = 107) evaluated the workshop positively. In 2017, 16/41 survey responders (39%) reported never applying in practice; barriers included role restrictions (14/41, 34%) and lack of time (5/41, 12%). SPIRIT-PRO overall scores did not differ between workshop (n = 13, median = 3.81/10, interquartile range = 3.24) and control protocols (n = 9, 3.51/10 (2.14)), (p = 0.35). Workshop protocols scored higher than controls on two items: 'specify PRO concepts/domains' (p = 0.05); 'methods for handling missing data' (p = 0.044). Conclusion Although participants were highly satisfied with these workshops, the completeness of PRO protocol content generally did not improve. Additional knowledge translation efforts are needed to assist protocol writers address SPIRIT-PRO guidance and avoid research waste that may eventuate from sub-optimal PRO protocol content."

The biological rationale behind injection of a steroid solution is unclear, and it is uncertain whether the addition of steroids offers any additional benefits over injection of LA alone. We propose to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to summarize the evidence for using steroids and LA vs. LA alone in the treatment of CNCP. Methods: An experienced librarian will perform a comprehensive search of EMBASE, MEDLINE, and the Cochrane Central Registry of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) databases with search terms for clinical indications, LA, and steroid agents. We will review bibliographies of all relevant published reviews in the last 5 years for additional studies. Eligible trials will be published in English and randomly allocate patients with CNCP to treatment with steroid and LA injection therapy or injection with LA alone. We will use the guidelines published by the Initiative on Methods, Measurement, and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials (IMMPACT) to inform the outcomes that we collect and present. Teams of reviewers will independently and in duplicate assess trial eligibility, abstract data, and assess risk of bias among eligible trials. We will prioritize intention to treat analysis and, when possible, pool outcomes across trials using random effects models. We will report our findings as risk differences, weighted mean differences, or standardized mean differences for individual outcomes. Further, to ensure interpretability of our results, we will present risk differences and measures of relative effect for pain reduction based on anchor-based minimally important clinical differences. We will conduct a priori defined subgroup analyses and use the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system to evaluate the certainty of the evidence on an outcome-by-outcome basis. Discussion: Our review will evaluate both the effectiveness and the adverse events associated with steroid plus LA vs. LA alone for CNCP, evaluate the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach, and prioritize patient-important outcomes guided by IMMPACT recommendations. Our results will facilitate evidence-based management of patients with chronic non-cancer pain and identify key areas for future research."

Several automated risk prediction models have been developed using retrospective clinical data and have evolved significantly over the years in terms of predictors of recurrence, data usage, and predictive techniques (statistical/machine learning [ML]). METHODS Following PRISMA guidelines, we performed a systematic literature review of the aforementioned statistical and ML models published between January 2008 and December 2022 through searching five digital databases-PubMed, ScienceDirect, Scopus, Cochrane, and Web of Science. The comprehensive search yielded a total of 163 papers and after a screening process focusing on papers that dealt exclusively with statistical/ML methods, only 23 papers were deemed appropriate for further analysis. We benchmarked the studies on the basis of development, evaluation metrics, and validation strategy with an added emphasis on racial diversity of patients included in the studies. RESULTS In total, 30.4% of the included studies use statistical techniques, while 69.6% are ML-based. Among these, traditional ML models (support vector machines, decision tree, logistic regression, and naive Bayes) are the most frequently used (26.1%) along with deep learning (26.1%). Deep learning and ensemble learning provide the most accurate predictions (AUC = 0.94 each). CONCLUSION ML-based prediction models exhibit outstanding performance, yet their practical applicability might be hindered by limited interpretability and reduced generalization. Moreover, predictive models for BC recurrence often focus on limited variables related to tumor, treatment, molecular, and clinical features. Imbalanced classes and the lack of open-source data sets impede model development and validation. Furthermore, existing models predominantly overlook African and Middle Eastern populations, as they are trained and validated mainly on Caucasian and Asian patients."

This research paper investigates the integration of YOLOv5, a state-of-the-art object detection framework, with non-local neural networks (NLNNs) to improve brain tumor detection's robustness and accuracy. This study begins by curating a comprehensive dataset comprising brain MRI scans from various sources. To facilitate effective fusion, the YOLOv5 and NLNNs, K-means+, and spatial pyramid pooling fast+ (SPPF+) modules are integrated within a unified framework. The brain tumor dataset is used to refine the YOLOv5 model through the application of transfer learning techniques, adapting it specifically to the task of tumor detection. The results indicate that the combination of YOLOv5 and other modules results in enhanced detection capabilities in comparison to the utilization of YOLOv5 exclusively, proving recall rates of 86% and 83% respectively. Moreover, the research explores the interpretability aspect of the combined model. By visualizing the attention maps generated by the NLNNs module, the regions of interest associated with tumor presence are highlighted, aiding in the understanding and validation of the decision-making procedure of the methodology. Additionally, the impact of hyperparameters, such as NLNNs kernel size, fusion strategy, and training data augmentation, is investigated to optimize the performance of the combined model."

However, it is very challenging to achieve satisfactory performance in LNM classification, because both the morphology and spatial distribution of tumor regions should be taken into account. To address this problem, this article proposes a two-stage dMIL-Transformer framework, which integrates both the morphological and spatial information of the tumor regions based on the theory of multiple instance learning (MIL). In the first stage, a double Max-Min MIL (dMIL) strategy is devised to select the suspected top-K positive instances from each input histopathology image, which contains tens of thousands of patches (primarily negative). The dMIL strategy enables a better decision boundary for selecting the critical instances compared with other methods. In the second stage, a Transformer-based MIL aggregator is designed to integrate all the morphological and spatial information of the selected instances from the first stage. The self-attention mechanism is further employed to characterize the correlation between different instances and learn the bag-level representation for predicting the LNM category. The proposed dMIL-Transformer can effectively deal with the thorny classification in LNM with great visualization and interpretability. We conduct various experiments over three LNM datasets, and achieve 1.79%-7.50% performance improvement compared with other state-of-the-art methods."

Some variants of PCA have been proposed to improve the interpretation of the principal components (PCs). One of the most common methods is sparse PCA which aims at finding a sparse basis to improve the interpretability over the dense basis of PCA. However, the performances of these improved methods are still far from satisfactory because the data still contain redundant PCs. In this paper, a novel method called PCA based on graph Laplacian and double sparse constraints (GDSPCA) is proposed to improve the interpretation of the PCs and consider the internal geometry of the data. In detail, GDSPCA utilizes L-2,L-1-norm and L-1-norm regularization terms simultaneously to enforce the matrix to be sparse by filtering redundant and irrelative PCs, where the L-2,L-1-norm regularization term can produce row sparsity, while the L-1-norm regularization term can enforce element sparsity. This way, we can make a better interpretation of the new PCs in low-dimensional subspace.

Kernels offer a nonlinear version of any linear algorithm solely based on dot products. The kernelized version of principal component analysis is a valid nonlinear alternative to tackle the nonlinearity of biological sample spaces. This paper proposes a novel methodology to obtain a data-driven feature importance based on the kernel PCA representation of the data.ResultsThe proposed method, kernel PCA Interpretable Gradient (KPCA-IG), provides a data-driven feature importance that is computationally fast and based solely on linear algebra calculations. It has been compared with existing methods on three benchmark datasets. The accuracy obtained using KPCA-IG selected features is equal to or greater than the other methods' average. Also, the computational complexity required demonstrates the high efficiency of the method. An exhaustive literature search has been conducted on the selected genes from a publicly available Hepatocellular carcinoma dataset to validate the retained features from a biological point of view. The results once again remark on the appropriateness of the computed ranking.ConclusionsThe black-box nature of kernel PCA needs new methods to interpret the original features. Our proposed methodology KPCA-IG proved to be a valid alternative to select influential variables in high-dimensional high-throughput datasets, potentially unravelling new biological and medical biomarkers."

Among the various techniques, adaptive l(1)-regularization is an effective framework to improve the convergence behaviour of the LASSO, by using varying strength of regularization across different features. In the meantime, the adaptive structure makes it very powerful in modelling grouped sparsity patterns as well, being particularly useful in high-dimensional multi-task problems. However, choosing an appropriate, global regularization weight is still an open problem. In this paper, inspired by the annealing technique in material science, we propose to achieve annealed sparsity by designing a dynamic shrinking scheme that simultaneously optimizes the regularization weights and model coefficients in sparse (multi-task) learning. The dynamic structures of our algorithm are twofold. Feature-wise (spatially), the regularization weights are updated interactively with model coefficients, allowing us to improve the global regularization structure. Iteration-wise (temporally), such interaction is coupled with gradually boosted l(1)-regularization by adjusting an equality norm-constraint, achieving an annealing effect to further improve model selection. This renders interesting shrinking behaviour in the whole solution path. Our method competes favorably with state-of-the-art methods in sparse (multi-task) learning. We also apply it in expression quantitative trait loci analysis (eQTL), which gives useful biological insights in human cancer (melanoma) study."

In this study, we developed an interpretable AI model that predicts dose fractionation for patients receiving radiation therapy for brain metastases with an interpretation of its decision-making process.Materials/Methods: 152 patients with brain metastases treated by radiosurgery from 2017 to 2021 were obtained. CT images and target and organ-at-risk (OAR) contours were extracted. Eight non-image clinical parameters were also extracted and digitized, including age, the number of brain metastasis, ECOG performance status, presence of symptoms, sequencing with surgery (pre-or post-operative radiation therapy), de novo vs. re-treatment, primary cancer type, and metastasis to other sites. 3D convolutional neural networks (CNN) architectures with encoding paths were built based on the CT data and clinical parameters to capture three inputs: (1) Tumor size, shape, and location; (2) The spatial relationship between tumors and OARs; (3) The clinical parameters. The models fuse the features extracted from these three inputs at the decision-making level to learn the input independently to predict dose prescription. Models with different independent paths were developed, including models combining two independent paths (IM-2), three independent paths (IM-3), and ten independent paths (IM-10) at the decision-making level. A class activation score and relative weighting were calculated for each input path during the model prediction to represent the role of each input in the decision-making process, providing an interpretation of the model prediction. The actual prescription in the record was used as ground truth for model training. The model performance was assessed by 19-fold cross-validation, with each fold consisting of randomly selected 128 training, 16 validation, and 8 testing subjects.Result: The dose prescriptions of 152 patient cases included 48 cases with 1 x 24 Gy, 48 cases with 1 x 20-22 Gy, 32 cases with 3 x 9 Gy, and 24 cases with 5 x 6 Gy prescribed by 8 physicians. IM-2 achieved slightly superior performance than IM-3 and IM-10, with 131 (86%) patients classified correctly and 21 (14%) patients misclassified. IM-10 provided the most interpretability with a relative weighting for each input: target (34%), the relationship between target and OAR (35%), ECOG (6%), re-treatment (6%), metastasis to other sites (6%), number of brain metastases (3%), symptomatic (3%), pre/postsurgery (3%), primary cancer type (2%), age (2%), reflecting the importance of the inputs in decision making. The importance ranking of inputs interpreted from the model also matched closely with a physician's own ranking in the decision process.Conclusion: Interpretable CNN models were successfully developed to use CT images and non-image clinical parameters to predict dose prescriptions for brain metastases patients treated by radiosurgery. Models showed high prediction accuracy while providing an interpretation of the decision process, which was validated by the physician. Such interpretability makes the model more transparent, which is crucial for the future clinical adoption of the models in routine practice for CDM assistance.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

Deep learning models have shown promising results in detecting retinoblastoma from fundus images, but their decision-making process is often considered a black box that lacks transparency and interpretability. In this project, we explore the use of LIME and SHAP, two popular explainable AI techniques, to generate local and global explanations for a deep learning model based on InceptionV3 architecture trained on retinoblastoma and non-retinoblastoma fundus images. We collected and labeled a dataset of 400 retinoblastoma and 400 non-retinoblastoma images, split it into training, validation, and test sets, and trained the model using transfer learning from the pre-trained InceptionV3 model. We then applied LIME and SHAP to generate explanations for the model's predictions on the validation and test sets. Our results demonstrate that LIME and SHAP can effectively identify the regions and features in the input images that contribute the most to the model's predictions, providing valuable insights into the decision-making process of the deep learning model. In addition, the use of InceptionV3 architecture with spatial attention mechanism achieved high accuracy of 97% on the test set, indicating the potential of combining deep learning and explainable AI for improving retinoblastoma diagnosis and treatment."

Materials and methods The described method was a combination of non-supervised clustering and extraction of intratumoral complexity features (ICF): number of non-connected objects, volume fraction. It was applied to a set of 3D DCE-MRI K-trans maps acquired previously on tumor bearing mice prior to and on day 4 of anti-angiogenic treatment. Evolutions of ICF were compared to conventional summary statistics (CSS) and to heterogeneity related whole tumor texture features (TF) on treated (n = 9) and control (n = 6) mice. Results Computed optimal number of clusters per tumor was 4. Several intratumoral features extracted from the clusters were able to monitor a therapy effect. Whereas no feature significantly changed for the control group, 6 features significantly changed for the treated group (4 ICF, 2 CSS). Among these, 5 also significantly differentiated the two groups (3 ICF, 2 CSS). TF failed in demonstrating differences within and between the two groups. Discussion ICF are potential imaging biomarkers for anti-angiogenic therapy assessment. The presented method may be expected to have advantages with respect to texture analysis-based methods regarding interpretability of results and setup of standardized image analysis protocols."

To detect carcinoma, pathologists observe tissue samples at multiple magnifications, which is time-consuming and prone to inter- or intra-observer variability. The key challenge for automation of squamous cell carcinoma diagnosis is to extract the features at low (100x) magnification and explain the decision -making process to healthcare professionals. The existing literature used either machine learning or deep learning models to detect squamous cell carcinoma of specific organs. In this work, we report on the implementation of an explainable diagnostic aid system for squamous cell carcinoma of any organ and present a comparative analysis with state-of-the-art models. A classifier with an ensemble feature selection technique is developed to provide an automatic diagnostic aid for distinguishing between squamous cell carcinoma positive and negative cases based on histopathological images. Moreover, explainable AI techniques such as ELI5, LIME and SHAP are introduced to machine learning model which provides feature interpretability of prediction made by the classifier. The results show that the machine learning model achieved an accuracy of 93.43% and 96.66% on public and multi -centric private datasets, respectively. The proposed CatBoost classifier achieved remarkable performance in diagnosing multi -organ squamous cell carcinoma from low magnification histopathological images, even when various illumination variations were introduced."

The consequences of missed injuries and difficulties in injury clearance for non-verbal patients have led to a tendency to image young children. Imaging, particularly computed tomography (CT) scans, presents risks including radiation-induced carcinogenesis. In this study we leverage machine learning methods to develop highly accurate clinical decision rules to predict pediatric CSI. Methods: The PEDSPINE I registry was used to investigate CSI in blunt trauma patients under the age of three. Predictive models were built using Optimal Classification Trees, a novel machine learning approach offering high accuracy and interpretability, as well as other widely used machine learning methods. Results: The final Optimal Classification Trees model predicts injury based on overall Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) and patient age. This model has a sensitivity of 93.3% and specificity of 82.3% on the full dataset It has comparable or superior peiforrnance to other machine learning methods as well as existing clinical decision rules. Conclusions: This study developed a decision rule that achieves high injury identification while reducing unnecessary imaging. It demonstrates the value of machine learning in improving clinical decision protocols for pediatric trauma. Type of study: Retrospective Prognosis Study. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

However, challenging applications and recent advances in computer vision suggest that CNNs are limited in their ability to understand the spatial correspondence between features, which is at the core of image registration. The issue is further exaggerated when it comes to multi-modal image registration, where the appearances of input images can differ significantly. This paper presents a novel cross-modal attention mechanism for correlating features extracted from the multi-modal input images and mapping such correlation to image registration transformation. To efficiently train the developed network, a contrastive learning-based pre-training method is also proposed to aid the network in extracting high-level features across the input modalities for the following cross-modal attention learning. We validated the proposed method on transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) to magnetic resonance (MR) registration, a clinically important procedure that benefits prostate cancer biopsy. Our experimental results demonstrate that for MR-TRUS registration, a deep neural network embedded with the cross-modal attention block outperforms other advanced CNN-based networks with ten times its size. We also incorporated visualization techniques to improve the interpretability of our network, which helps bring insights into the deep learning based image registration methods.

Aiming at the characteristics of different sizes of nuclei in pathological images, this study developed a new segmentation network with excellent cross-scale description ability called DIU-Net. To enhance the generalization ability of the segmentation network, that is, to avoid the segmentation network from learning low-level features, we proposed the Complementary Color Conversion Scheme in the training phase. In addition, due to the disparity between the area of the nucleus and the background in the pathology image, there is an inherent data imbalance phenomenon, dice loss and focal loss were used to overcome this problem. In order to further strengthen the classification performance of the model, this study adopted a joint training scheme, so that the output of the classification network can not only be used to optimize the classification network itself, but also optimize the segmentation network. In addition, this model can also provide the pathologist model's attention area, increasing the model's interpretability. The classification performance verification of the proposed method was carried out with the BreaKHis dataset. Our method obtains binary/multi-class classification accuracy 97.24/93.75 and 98.19/94.43 for 200x and 400x images, outperforming existing methods."

The development of trustworthy AI is especially important in medicine due to the large implications for patients' lives. While trustworthiness concerns various aspects including ethical, transparency and safety requirements, we focus on the importance of data quality (training/test) in DL. Since data quality dictates the behaviour of ML products, evaluating data quality will play a key part in the regulatory approval of medical ML products. We perform a systematic review following PRISMA guidelines using the databases Web of Science, PubMed and ACM Digital Library. We identify 5408 studies, out of which 120 records fulfil our eligibility criteria. From this literature, we synthesise the existing knowledge on data quality frameworks and combine it with the perspective of ML applications in medicine. As a result, we propose the METRIC-framework, a specialised data quality framework for medical training data comprising 15 awareness dimensions, along which developers of medical ML applications should investigate the content of a dataset. This knowledge helps to reduce biases as a major source of unfairness, increase robustness, facilitate interpretability and thus lays the foundation for trustworthy AI in medicine. The METRIC-framework may serve as a base for systematically assessing training datasets, establishing reference datasets, and designing test datasets which has the potential to accelerate the approval of medical ML products."

One of the most debilitating complications of diabetes mellitus is the diabetic foot (DF), resulting in an increased risk of hospitalization and significant morbidity and mortality. Amputation above or below the knee is a feared complication and the mortality in these patients is higher than for most forms of cancer. Identifying and interpreting relationships existing among the factors involved in DF diagnosis is still challenging. Although machine learning approaches have proven to achieve great accuracy in DF prediction, few advances have been performed in understanding how they make such predictions, resulting in mistrust of their use in real contexts. In this study, we present an approach based on Genetic Programming to build a simple global explainable classifier, named X-GPC, which, unlike existing tools such as LIME and SHAP, provides a global interpretation of the DFU diagnosis through a mathematical model. Also, an easy consultable 3d graph is provided, which could be used by the medical staff to figure out the patients' situation and take decisions for patients' healing.

Genomic data capture genetic and environmental state, providing information on heterogeneity in disease and treatment outcome, but genomic-based clinical risk scores are limited. Achieving the goal of routine precision medicine that takes advantage of these rich genomics data will require computational methods that support heterogeneous data, have excellent predictive performance, and ideally, provide biologically interpretable results. Traditional machine-learning approaches excel at performance, but often have limited interpretability. Patient similarity networks are an emerging paradigm for precision medicine, in which patients are clustered or classified based on their similarities in various features, including genomic profiles. This strategy is analogous to standard medical diagnosis, has excellent performance, is interpretable, and can preserve patient privacy. We review new methods based on patient similarity networks, including Similarity Network Fusion for patient clustering and netDx for patient classification. While these methods are already useful, much work is required to improve their scalability for contemporary genetic cohorts, optimize parameters, and incorporate a wide range of genomics and clinical data. The coming 5 years will provide an opportunity to assess the utility of network-based algorithms for precision medicine. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd."

Similarly, the scheduling of radiotherapy for cancer treatments needs to handle patients with different urgency levels when allocating resources. High-priority patients may arrive at any time, and there must be resources available to accommodate them. A common solution is to reserve a flat percentage of treatment capacity for emergency patients. However, this solution can result in overdue treatments for urgent patients, a failure to fully exploit treatment capacity, and delayed treatments for low-priority patients. This problem is especially severe in large and crowded hospitals. In this paper, we propose a prediction-based approach for online dynamic radiotherapy scheduling that dynamically adapts the present scheduling decision based on each incoming patient and the current allocation of resources. Our approach is based on a regression model trained to recognize the links between patients' arrival patterns and their ideal waiting time in optimal off-line solutions when all future arrivals are known in advance.

Common approaches use either a Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) or a hidden Markov model (HMM) description, depending on the level of detail of the functionality and structural changes of the underlying channel gating, and taking into account the computational effort for model simulations. Here, we introduce for the first time a novel system theory-based approach for ion channel modeling based on the concept of transfer function characterization, without a priori knowledge of the biological system, using patch clamp measurements. Using the shaker-related voltage-gated potassium channel Kv1.1 (KCNA1) as an example, we compare the established approaches, HH and HMM, with the system theory-based concept in terms of model accuracy, computational effort, the degree of electrophysiological interpretability, and methodological limitations. This highly data-driven modeling concept offers a new opportunity for the phenomenological kinetic modeling of ion channels, exhibiting exceptional accuracy and computational efficiency compared to the conventional methods. The method has a high potential to further improve the quality and computational performance of complex cell and organ model simulations, and could provide a valuable new tool in the field of next-generation in silico electrophysiology."

We assessed the quality of reporting of the information required to design SMART studies. Study design and setting: We systematically searched four databases (PubMed, Ovid, Web of Science and Scopus) for all trial reports, protocols, reviews, and methodological papers which mentioned SMART designs up to June 15, 2020. Results: Of the 157 selected records, 12 (7.64%) were trial reports, 24 (15.29%) were study protocols, 91 (58%) were methodological papers, and 30 (19.1%) were review papers. All these trials were powered using stage-specific aims. Only four (33.33%) of these trials reported parameters required for sample size calculations. A small number of the trials (16.67 %) were interested in determining the best embedded adaptive interventions. Most of the trials did not report information about multiple testing adjustment. Furthermore, most of records reported designs that were mainly focused on stage-specific aims. Conclusions: Some features of SMART designs are seldomly reported and/or used. Furthermore, studies using this design tend to not adequately report information about all the design parameters, limiting their transparency and interpretability. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

It is gaining increased popularity in the (bio)medical imaging community since it may provide a possibility to, while relying only on weak labels assigned to large regions, obtain more fine-grained information. However, processing very large bags in end-to-end MIL is problematic due to computer memory constraints. We propose within-bag sampling as one way of applying end-to-end MIL methods on very large data. We explore how different levels of sampling affect the performance of a well-known high-performing end-to-end attention-based MIL method, to understand the conditions when sampling can be utilized. We compose two new datasets tailored for the purpose of the study, and propose a strategy for sampling during MIL inference to arrive at reliable bag labels as well as instance level attention weights. We perform experiments without and with different levels of sampling, on the two publicly available datasets, and for a range of learning settings. We observe that in most situations the proposed bag-level sampling can be applied to end-to-end MIL without performance loss, supporting its confident usage to enable end-to-end MIL also in scenarios with very large bags.

This study aims to develop an algorithm capable of differentiating a set of dermoscopic images depending on whether the tumor is benign or malignant. The priority of this research is to obtain the importance of each extracted feature. This work is focused on the ABCD rule feature analysis and it aims to find the relevance of each feature and its performance in a classification model. A relevant aspect of this study is the use of a heterogeneous database, where the images were uploaded by different sources worldwide. A combination of novel and previously used features are analyzed and their importance is computed by the use of a Gaussian mixture model. After selecting the most discriminant features, a set of classification models was applied to find the best model with the less quantity of features. We found that a total of 65.89% of the features could be omitted with a loss in accuracy, sensibility and specificity equal or lower than 2%. While similar performance measures have been employed in other studies, most results are not comparable, as the databases used were more homogeneous.

Compared with wet experiments, computational methods of identifying PHIs can reduce costs and save time and are more effective and economic. In this paper, we propose a PHI prediction method with a generative adversarial network (GAN)-based data augmentation and sequence-based feature fusion (PHIAF). First, PHIAF applies a GAN-based data augmentation module, which generates pseudo PHIs to alleviate the data scarcity. Second, PHIAF fuses the features originated from DNA and protein sequences for better performance. Third, PHIAF utilizes an attention mechanism to consider different contributions of DNA/protein sequence-derived features, which also provides interpretability of the prediction model. In computational experiments, PHIAF outperforms other state-of-the-art PHI prediction methods when evaluated via 5-fold cross-validation (AUC and AUPR are 0.88 and 0.86, respectively). An ablation study shows that data augmentation, feature fusion and an attention mechanism are all beneficial to improve the prediction performance of PHIAF. Additionally, four new PHIs with the highest PHIAF score in the case study were verified by recent literature. In conclusion, PHIAF is a promising tool to accelerate the exploration of phage therapy."

Objective: To evaluate oncologists' perceptions concerning the availability and quality of information generated from PRO measures. Additionally, to identify whether an association exists between perceptions of availability and attitudes concerning quality. Method: An online, 11-item questionnaire was developed to capture clinician perspectives on the availability and use of PRO data to inform practice. The survey also asked respondents to rate information on the basis of 4 quality metrics: usefulness, interpretability, accessibility, and scientific rigor. Results: Responses were received from 298 of 1301 invitations sent (22.9% response rate). Perceptions regarding the availability of PRO information differed widely among respondents and did not appear to be linked to practice setting. Ratings of PRO quality were generally consistent, with average ratings for the 4 quality metrics between satisfactory and good. A relationship was observed between ratings of PRO data quality and perceptions of the availability. Conclusion: Oncologists' attitudes toward the quality of information generated from PRO measures are favorable but not enthusiastic. These attitudes may improve as the availability of PRO data increases, given the association we observed between oncologists' ratings of the quality of PRO information and their perceptions of its availability."

The proliferation of this approach is due to better interpretability of its results and its higher statistical power compared with the gene-level statistics. A plethora of pathway analysis methods that utilize multi-omics setup, rather than just transcriptomics or proteomics, have recently been developed to discover novel pathways and biomarkers. Since multi-omics gives multiple views into the same problem, different approaches are employed in aggregating these views into a comprehensive biological context. As a result, a variety of novel hypotheses regarding disease ideation and treatment targets can be formulated. In this article, we review 32 such pathway analysis methods developed for multi-omics and multi-cohort data. We discuss their availability and implementation, assumptions, supported omics types and databases, pathway analysis techniques and integration strategies. A comprehensive assessment of each method's practicality, and a thorough discussion of the strengths and drawbacks of each technique will be provided.

The use of artificial intelligence and knowledge graphs to propose repurposing candidates facilitates the process, as large amounts of data can be processed. However, it is important to pay attention to the explainability needed to validate the predictions. We propose a general architecture to understand several explainable methods for graph completion based on knowledge graphs and design our own architecture for drug repurposing. We present XG4Repo (eXplainable Graphs for Repurposing), a framework that takes advantage of the connectivity of any biomedical knowledge graph to link compounds to the diseases they can treat. Our method allows methapaths of different types and lengths, which are automatically generated and optimised based on data. XG4Repo focuses on providing meaningful explanations to the predictions, which are based on paths from compounds to diseases. These paths include nodes such as genes, pathways, side effects, or anatomies, so they provide information about the targets and other characteristics of the biomedical mechanism that link compounds and diseases. Paths make predictions interpretable for experts who can validate them and use them in further research on drug repurposing. We also describe three use cases where we analyse new uses for Epirubicin, Paclitaxel, and Predinisone and present the paths that support the predictions."

Deep learning-based drug prediction methods have shown promise by integrating cancer-related multi-omics data. However, the complex interaction between genes poses challenges in accurately projecting multi-omics data. In this research, we present a predictive model for drug response that incorporates diverse types of omics data, comprising genetic mutation, copy number variation, methylation, and gene expression data. This study proposes latent alignment for information mismatch in integration, which is achieved through an attention module capturing interactions among diverse types of omics data. The latent alignment and attention modules significantly improve predictions, outperforming the baseline model, with MSE = 1.1333, F1-score = 0.5342, and AUROC = 0.5776. High accuracy was achieved in predicting drug responses for piplartine and tenovin-6, while the accuracy was comparatively lower for mitomycin-C and obatoclax. The latent alignment module exclusively outperforms the baseline model, enhancing the MSE by 0.2375, the F1-score by 4.84%, and the AUROC by 6.1%. Similarly, the attention module only improves these metrics by 0.1899, 2.88%, and 2.84%, respectively. In the interpretability case study, panobinostat exhibited the most effective predicted response, with a value of -4.895. We provide reliable insights for drug selection in personalized medicine by identifying crucial genetic factors influencing drug response."

Taking the diagnosis of thyroid nodules as an example, this study compares three assumptions, namely deletion, imputation based on the distribution (distribution), and benign by default (benign). For deletion, which is the most used assumption, the clinical reports with missing features would be deleted. For distribution, the missing features would be replaced with a distribution of features with respective probabilities. Besides the two assumptions, certain doctors have also stated that they leave benign features unrecorded because they think that such benign features are irrelevant to the final diagnosis. Under the benign assumption, the missing features would be replaced with benign features. The three assumptions are tested comparatively. Moreover, the belief rule base (BRB) is used to construct the diagnostic model under the three assumptions since it is essentially a white-box approach that can provide good interpretability and direct access to doctors and patients. A total of 3766 clinical reports on thyroid nodule diagnosis were collected from ten radiologists over a seven-year period. Case study results validate that the benign by default assumption has produced the optimal results, although different doctors could present varied tendencies towards different assumptions. Guidance and suggestions for doctors' practical work have been made based on the study results to improve work efficiency and diagnostic accuracy."

Accordingly, this study aimed to develop and determine the psychometric properties of the Health-Promoting Lifestyle Scale in CRC Survivors (HPLS-CRCS).MethodsThis study was a mixed study with an exploratory sequential design in two phases. Concept analysis was performed in the first phase according to Schwartz-Barcott and Kim's (2000) hybrid model to explain the concept, identify dimensions, and generate items. In the second phase, psychometrics including validity (face, content, and construct) and reliability (internal consistency and stability) were determined. Responsiveness, interpretability, ease of use, item weighting, and scale scoring were also determined.ResultsAfter explaining the concept, an initial scale encompassing 211 items was developed, content and item analyses were conducted, and the items decreased to 89 items after the face validity assessment. For construct validity, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted with a sample size of 500 survivors, and convergent validity was performed for the Persian version of the Health-Promoting Lifestyle Profile II (HPLP-II). Accordingly, 80 items were classified into six factors: activity and rest, spiritual growth, health responsibility, nutrition, interpersonal relationships, and psychological management, with RMSEA = 0.055, chi 2/df = 2.484, and chi 2 = 6816.516. The reliability of the scale was confirmed, Cronbach's alpha was between 0.865 and 0.928, and the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), the standard error of measurement (SEM), the minimal important change (MIC), and the smallest detectable change (SDC) were 0.896, 3.36, 13.86, and 19.87, respectively.ConclusionThe HPLS-CRCS consists of 80 items in six dimensions and is a valid and reliable scale for evaluating the health-promoting lifestyle in CRC survivors. Using this scale to evaluate the healthy lifestyle in these survivors can lead healthcare providers to detect deficiencies and plan the lifestyle of CRC survivors during the post-treatment period."

Balanced Functional Module Detection in genomic data	BIOINFORMATICS ADVANCES			English	Article							ENDOMETRIAL; SELECTION; CANCER	"MotivationHigh-dimensional genomic data can be analyzed to understand the effects of variables on a target variable such as a clinical outcome. For understanding the underlying biological mechanism affecting the target, it is important to discover the complete set of relevant variables. Thus variable selection is a primary goal, which differs from a prediction criterion. Of special interest are functional modules, cooperating sets of variables affecting the target which can be characterized by a graph. In applications such as social networks, the concept of balance in undirected signed graphs characterizes the consistency of associations within the network. This property requires that the module variables have a joint effect on the target outcome with no internal conflict, an efficiency that may be applied to biological networks.ResultsIn this paper, we model genomic variables in signed undirected graphs for applications where the set of predictor variables influences an outcome. Consequences of the balance property are exploited to implement a new module discovery algorithm, balanced Functional Module Detection (bFMD), which selects a subset of variables from high-dimensional data that compose a balanced functional module. Our bFMD algorithm performed favorably in simulations as compared to other module detection methods. Additionally, bFMD detected interpretable results in an application using RNA-seq data obtained from subjects with Uterine Corpus Endometrial Carcinoma using the percentage of tumor invasion as the outcome of interest. The variables selected by bFMD have improved interpretability due to the logical consistency afforded by the balance property.Supplementary information are available at Bioinformatics Advances online."

Automated, comprehensive disease modeling requires a machine-learning approach that can simultaneously identify disease subgroups and their defining molecular biomarkers by explaining multiple clinical endpoints. Current tools are restricted to individual endpoints or limited variable types, necessitate advanced computation skills, and require resource-intensive manual expert interpretation.Results We developed Multi-Target Automated Tree Engine (MuTATE) for automated and comprehensive molecular modeling, which enables user-friendly multi-objective decision tree construction and visualization of relationships between molecular biomarkers and patient subgroups characterized by multiple clinical endpoints. MuTATE incorporates multiple targets throughout model construction and allows for target weights, enabling construction of interpretable decision trees that provide insights into disease heterogeneity and molecular signatures. MuTATE eliminates the need for manual synthesis of multiple non-explainable models, making it highly efficient and accessible for bioinformaticians and clinicians. The flexibility and versatility of MuTATE make it applicable to a wide range of complex diseases, including cancer, where it can improve therapeutic decisions by providing comprehensive molecular insights for precision medicine. MuTATE has the potential to transform biomarker discovery and subtype identification, leading to more effective and personalized treatment strategies in precision medicine, and advancing our understanding of disease mechanisms at the molecular level.Availability and implementation MuTATE is freely available at GitHub (https://github.com/SarahAyton/MuTATE) under the GPLv3 license."

Although highly interpretable, these methods lack the ability to handle the uncertainty associated with intra-operative decision making. In this paper for the first time, we propose Evidential Graph Transformer network, a combination of attention mapping and uncertainty estimation to increase the performance and interpretability of surgical margin assessment. METHODS: The Evidential Graph Transformer was formulated to output the uncertainty estimation along with intermediate attentions. The performance of the model was compared with different baselines in an ex-vivo cross-validation scheme, with extensive ablation study. The association of the model with clinical features were explored. The model was further validated for a prospective ex-vivo data, as well as a breast conserving surgery intra-operative data. RESULTS: The purposed model outperformed all baselines, statistically significantly, with average balanced accuracy of 91.6%. When applied to intra-operative data, the purposed model improved the false positive rate of the baselines. The estimated attention distribution for status of different hormone receptors agreed with reported metabolic findings in the literature. CONCLUSION: Deployment of ex-vivo models is challenging due to the tissue heterogeneity of intra-operative data.

However, current methods for CD276 detection are time-consuming and expensive, limiting extensive studies and applications of CD276. We aimed to develop a pathomic model for CD276 prediction from H&E-stained pathological images, and explore the underlying mechanism of the pathomic features by associating the pathomic model with transcription profiles. A dataset of colon adenocarcinoma (COAD) patients was retrieved from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. The dataset was divided into the training and validation sets according to the ratio of 8:2 by a stratified sampling method. Using the gradient boosting machine (GBM) algorithm, we established a pathomic model to predict CD276 expression in COAD. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were conducted to assess the predictive performance of the pathomic model for overall survival in COAD. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GESA) was performed to explore the underlying biological mechanisms of the pathomic model. The pathomic model formed by three pathomic features for CD276 prediction showed an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.833 (95%CI: 0.784-0.882) in the training set and 0.758 (95%CI: 0.637-0.878) in the validation set, respectively. The calibration curves and Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness of fit test showed that the prediction probability of high/low expression of CD276 was in favorable agreement with the real situation in both the training and validation sets (P=0.176 and 0.255, respectively). The DCA curves suggested that the pathomic model acquired high clinical benefit. All the subjects were categorized into high pathomic score (PS) (PS-H) and low PS (PS-L) groups according to the cutoff value of PS. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that PS was a risk factor for overall survival in COAD. Furthermore, through GESA analysis, we found several immune and inflammatory-related pathways and genes were associated with the pathomic model. We constructed a pathomics-based machine learning model for CD276 prediction directly from H&E-stained images in COAD. Through integrated analysis of the pathomic model and transcriptomics, the interpretability of the pathomic model provide a theoretical basis for further hypothesis and experimental research."

Many inflammatory indices, including the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), plateletto -lymphocyte ratio (PLR), monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio (MLR), and systemic immune -inflammatory index (SII), have been reported in PTC. However, the associations between the systemic inflammation response index (SIRI) and the risk of central lymph node metastasis (CLNM) remain unclear. Methods: Retrospective research involving 1,394 individuals with cN0T1-T2 PTC was carried out, and the included patients were randomly allocated into training (70%) and testing (30%) subgroups. The preoperative inflammatory indices and ultrasound (US) features were used to train the models. To assess the forecasting factors as well as drawing nomograms, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and multivariate logistic regression were utilized. Then eight interpretable models based on machine learning (ML) algorithms were constructed, including decision tree (DT), K -nearest neighbor (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN), random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM), and categorical boosting (CatBoost). The performance of the models was evaluated by incorporating the area under the precision -recall curve (auPR) and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (auROC), as well as other conventional metrics. The interpretability of the optimum model was illustrated via the shapley additive explanations (SHAP) approach. Results: Younger age, larger tumor size, capsular invasion, location (lower and isthmus), unclear margin, microcalcifications, color Doppler flow imaging (CDFI) blood flow, and higher SIRI (>= 0.77) were independent positive predictors of CLNM, whereas female sex and Hashimoto thyroiditis were independent negative predictors, and nomograms were subsequently constructed. Taking into account both the auROC and auPR, the RF algorithm showed the best performance, and superiority to XGBoost, CatBoost and ANN. In addition, the role of key variables was visualized in the SHAP plot. Conclusions: An interpretable ML model based on the SIRI and US features can be used to predict CLNM in individuals with cN0T1-T2 PTC."

Conventional radiomics rely on extraction of image features within a pre-defined image region of interest (ROI) which are typically fed to a classification algorithm for prediction of a clinical endpoint. Deep learning radiomics allows for a simpler workflow where images can be used directly as input to a convolutional neural network (CNN) with or without a pre-defined ROI.PurposeThe purpose of this study was to evaluate (i) conventional radiomics and (ii) deep learning radiomics for predicting overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) for patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) using pre-treatment 18F-fluorodeoxuglucose positron emission tomography (FDG PET) and computed tomography (CT) images.Materials and methodsFDG PET/CT images and clinical data of patients with HNSCC treated with radio(chemo)therapy at Oslo University Hospital (OUS; n = 139) and Maastricht University Medical Center (MAASTRO; n = 99) were collected retrospectively. OUS data was used for model training and initial evaluation. MAASTRO data was used for external testing to assess cross-institutional generalizability. Models trained on clinical and/or conventional radiomics features, with or without feature selection, were compared to CNNs trained on PET/CT images without or with the gross tumor volume (GTV) included. Model performance was measured using accuracy, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), Matthew's correlation coefficient (MCC), and the F1 score calculated for both classes separately.ResultsCNNs trained directly on images achieved the highest performance on external data for both endpoints. Adding both clinical and radiomics features to these image-based models increased performance further. Conventional radiomics including clinical data could achieve competitive performance. However, feature selection on clinical and radiomics data lead to overfitting and poor cross-institutional generalizability. CNNs without tumor and node contours achieved close to on-par performance with CNNs including contours.ConclusionHigh performance and cross-institutional generalizability can be achieved by combining clinical data, radiomics features and medical images together with deep learning models. However, deep learning models trained on images without contours can achieve competitive performance and could see potential use as an initial screening tool for high-risk patients."

The purpose of this study was to utilize a deep learning model with an advanced inception module to automatically contour critical organs on the computed tomography (CT) scans of head and neck cancer patients who underwent radiation therapy treatment and interpret the clinical suitability of the model results through activation mapping. Materials and methods. This study included 25 critical organs that were delineated by expert radiation oncologists. Contoured medical images of 964 patients were sourced from a publicly available TCIA database. The proportion of training, validation, and testing samples for deep learning model development was 65%, 25%, and 10% respectively. The CT scans and segmentation masks were augmented with shift, scale, and rotate transformations. Additionally, medical images were pre-processed using contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization to enhance soft tissue contrast while contours were subjected to morphological operations to ensure their structural integrity. The segmentation model was based on the U-Net architecture with embedded Inception-ResNet-v2 blocks and was trained over 100 epochs with a batch size of 32 and an adaptive learning rate optimizer. The loss function combined the Jaccard Index and binary cross entropy. The model performance was evaluated with Dice Score, Jaccard Index, and Hausdorff Distances. The interpretability of the model was analyzed with guided gradient-weighted class activation mapping. Results. The Dice Score, Jaccard Index, and mean Hausdorff Distance averaged over all structures and patients were 0.82 +/- 0.10, 0.71 +/- 0.10, and 1.51 +/- 1.17 mm respectively on the testing data sets. The Dice Scores for 86.4% of compared structures was within range or better than published interobserver variability derived from multi-institutional studies. The average model training time was 8 h per anatomical structure. The full segmentation of head and neck anatomy by the trained network required only 6.8 s per patient. Conclusions. High accuracy obtained on a large, multi-institutional data set, short segmentation time and clinically-realistic prediction reasoning make the model proposed in this work a feasible solution for head and neck CT scan segmentation in a clinical environment."

Teas from the plant Camellia sinensis can be grouped into green, black and oolong tea, and drinking habits vary cross-culturally. C sinensis contains polyphenols, one subgroup being catechins. Catechins are powerful antioxidants, and laboratory studies have suggested that these compounds may inhibit cancer cell proliferation. Some experimental and nonexperimental epidemiological studies have suggested that green tea may have cancer-preventative eGects. Objectives To assess possible associations between green tea consumption and the risk of cancer incidence and mortality as primary outcomes, and safety data and quality of life as secondary outcomes. Search methods We searched eligible studies up to January 2019 in CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, and reference lists of previous reviews and included studies. Selection criteria We included all epidemiological studies, experimental (i.e. randomised controlled trials (RCTs)) and nonexperimental (non-randomised studies, i.e. observational studies with both cohort and case-control design) that investigated the association of green tea consumption with cancer risk or quality of life, or both. Data collection and analysis Two or more review authors independently applied the study criteria, extracted data and assessed methodological quality of studies. We summarised the results according to diagnosis of cancer type. Main results In this review update, we included in total 142 completed studies (11 experimental and 131 nonexperimental) and two ongoing studies. This is an additional 10 experimental and 85 nonexperimental studies from those included in the previous version of the review. Eleven experimental studies allocated a total of 1795 participants to either green tea extract or placebo, all demonstrating an overall high methodological quality based on 'Risk of bias' assessment. For incident prostate cancer, the summary risk ratio (RR) in the green teasupplemented participants was 0.50 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.18 to 1.36), based on three studies and involving 201 participants (low-certainty evidence). The summary RR for gynaecological cancer was 1.50 (95% CI 0.41 to 5.48; 2 studies, 1157 participants; lowcertainty evidence). No evidence of eGect of non-melanoma skin cancer emerged (summary RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.06 to 15.92; 1 study, 1075 participants; low-certainty evidence). In addition, adverse eGects of green tea extract intake were reported, including gastrointestinal disorders, elevation of liver enzymes, and, more rarely, insomnia, raised blood pressure and skin/subcutaneous reactions. Consumption of green tea extracts induced a slight improvement in quality of life, compared with placebo, based on three experimental studies. In nonexperimental studies, we included over 1,100,000 participants from 46 cohort studies and 85 case-control studies, which were on average of intermediate to high methodological quality based on Newcastle-Ottawa Scale 'Risk of bias' assessment. When comparing the highest intake of green tea with the lowest, we found a lower overall cancer incidence (summary RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.07), based on three studies, involving 52,479 participants (low-certainty evidence). Conversely, we found no association between green tea consumption and cancer-related mortality (summary RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.07), based on eight studies and 504,366 participants (low-certainty evidence). For most of the site-specific cancers we observed a decreased RR in the highest category of green tea consumption compared with the lowest one. AKer stratifying the analysis according to study design, we found strongly conflicting results for some cancer sites: oesophageal, prostate and urinary tract cancer, and leukaemia showed an increased RR in cohort studies and a decreased RR or no diGerence in casecontrol studies. Authors' conclusions Overall, findings from experimental and nonexperimental epidemiological studies yielded inconsistent results, thus providing limited evidence for the beneficial eGect of green tea consumption on the overall risk of cancer or on specific cancer sites. Some evidence of a beneficial eGect of green tea at some cancer sites emerged from the RCTs and from case-control studies, but their methodological limitations, such as the low number and size of the studies, and the inconsistencies with the results of cohort studies, limit the interpretability of the RR estimates. The studies also indicated the occurrence of several side eGects associated with high intakes of green tea. In addition, the majority of included studies were carried out in Asian populations characterised by a high intake of green tea, thus limiting the generalisability of the findings to other populations. Well conducted and adequately powered RCTs would be needed to draw conclusions on the possible beneficial eGects of green tea consumption on cancer risk."

Pulmonary nodules are small abnormal regions that can be potentially correlated to the occurrence of lung cancer. Early detection of these nodules is critical because it can significantly improve the patient's survival rates. Thoracic thin-sliced computed tomography (CT) scanning has emerged as a widely used method for diagnosing and prognosis lung abnormalities.PurposeThe standard clinical workflow of detecting pulmonary nodules relies on radiologists to analyze CT images to assess the risk factors of cancerous nodules. However, this approach can be error-prone due to the various nodule formation causes, such as pollutants and infections. Deep learning (DL) algorithms have recently demonstrated remarkable success in medical image classification and segmentation. As an ever more important assistant to radiologists in nodule detection, it is imperative ensure the DL algorithm and radiologist to better understand the decisions from each other. This study aims to develop a framework integrating explainable AI methods to achieve accurate pulmonary nodule detection.MethodsA robust and explainable detection (RXD) framework is proposed, focusing on reducing false positives in pulmonary nodule detection. Its implementation is based on an explanation supervision method, which uses nodule contours of radiologists as supervision signals to force the model to learn nodule morphologies, enabling improved learning ability on small dataset, and enable small dataset learning ability. In addition, two imputation methods are applied to the nodule region annotations to reduce the noise within human annotations and allow the model to have robust attributions that meet human expectations. The 480, 265, and 265 CT image sets from the public Lung Image Database Consortium and Image Database Resource Initiative (LIDC-IDRI) dataset are used for training, validation, and testing.ResultsUsing only 10, 30, 50, and 100 training samples sequentially, our method constantly improves the classification performance and explanation quality of baseline in terms of Area Under the Curve (AUC) and Intersection over Union (IoU). In particular, our framework with a learnable imputation kernel improves IoU from baseline by 24.0% to 80.0%. A pre-defined Gaussian imputation kernel achieves an even greater improvement, from 38.4% to 118.8% from baseline. Compared to the baseline trained on 100 samples, our method shows less drop in AUC when trained on fewer samples. A comprehensive comparison of interpretability shows that our method aligns better with expert opinions.ConclusionsA pulmonary nodule detection framework was demonstrated using public thoracic CT image datasets. The framework integrates the robust explanation supervision (RES) technique to ensure the performance of nodule classification and morphology. The method can reduce the workload of radiologists and enable them to focus on the diagnosis and prognosis of the potential cancerous pulmonary nodules at the early stage to improve the outcomes for lung cancer patients."

The rising mortality rates and women's inadequate perception of the disease's severity in developing countries highlight the importance of screening using conventional methods and reliable scales. Since the validity and reliability of the breast cancer perception scale (BCPS) have not been established in the Iranian context. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the measurement properties of the BCPS in women residing in Tabriz, Iran.Methods The present study comprised a cross-sectional design, encompassing a sample of 372 Iranian women. The participants were selected through a multi-stage cluster random sampling technique conducted over a period spanning from November 2022 to February 2023. The measurement properties of the Iranian version of BCPS were assessed following the guidelines outlined in the COSMIN checklist. This involved conducting various steps, including the translation process, reliability testing (internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and measurement error), and methodological tests for validity (content validity, face validity, construct validity, and hypothesis testing). The study also investigated the factors of responsiveness and interpretability. The presence of floor and ceiling effects was assessed.Results The internal consistency of the scale was assessed using Cronbach's alpha, yielding a satisfactory value of 0.68. Additionally, McDonald's omega (95% CI) was computed, resulting in a value of 0.70 (0.66 to 0.74). Furthermore, the test-retest reliability was evaluated, revealing a high intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.97 (95% CI: 0.94 to 0.99). The CVI, CVR, and impact scores of the BCPS were determined to be 0.98, 0.95, and 3.70, respectively, indicating favorable levels of content and face validity. To assess construct validity, an examination of the Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) was conducted on a set of 24 items. This analysis revealed the presence of six distinct factors, which collectively accounted for 52% of the cumulative variance. The fit indices of the validity model (CFI = 0.91, NFI = 0.96, RFI = 0.94, TLI = 0.90, chi 2/df = 2.03, RMSEA = 0.055 and SRMR = 0.055) were confirmed during the confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). The overall score of BCPS exhibited a ceiling effect of 0.3%. The floor effect observed in the overall score (BCPS) was found to be 0.5%. Concerning the validation of the hypothesis, Spearman's correlation coefficient of 0.55 was obtained between the BCPS and the QLICP-BR V2.0. This correlation value signifies a statistically significant association. Furthermore, it is worth noting that the minimum important change (MIC) of 3.92 exhibited a higher value compared to the smallest detectable change (SDC) of 3.70, thus suggesting a satisfactory level of response.Conclusions The obtained findings suggest that the Iranian version of the BCPS demonstrates satisfactory psychometric properties for assessing the perception of breast cancer among Iranian women. Furthermore, it exhibits favorable responsiveness to clinical variations. Consequently, it can serve as a screening instrument for healthcare professionals to comprehend breast cancer and as a reliable tool in research endeavors."

However, the similarity between lung nodules and surrounding tissues has made their segmentation a longstanding challenge.PurposeExisting deep learning and active contour models each have their limitations. This paper aims to integrate the strengths of both approaches while mitigating their respective shortcomings.MethodsIn this paper, we propose a few-shot segmentation framework that combines a deep neural network with an active contour model. We introduce heat kernel convolutions and high-order total variation into the active contour model and solve the challenging nonsmooth optimization problem using the alternating direction method of multipliers. Additionally, we use the presegmentation results obtained from training a deep neural network on a small sample set as the initial contours for our optimized active contour model, addressing the difficulty of manually setting the initial contours.ResultsWe compared our proposed method with state-of-the-art methods for segmentation effectiveness using clinical computed tomography (CT) images acquired from two different hospitals and the publicly available LIDC dataset. The results demonstrate that our proposed method achieved outstanding segmentation performance according to both visual and quantitative indicators.ConclusionOur approach utilizes the output of few-shot network training as prior information, avoiding the need to select the initial contour in the active contour model. Additionally, it provides mathematical interpretability to the deep learning, reducing its dependency on the quantity of training samples."

Such a method primarily includes the Markov blanket (MB) discovery and feature selection based on Granger causality. Representatively, the max-min MB (MMMB) can mine an optimal feature subset, i.e., MB; however, it is unsuitable for streaming features. Online streaming feature selection (OSFS) via online process streaming features can determine parents and children (PC), a subset of MB; however, it cannot mine the MB of the target attribute (T), i.e., a given feature, thus resulting in insufficient prediction accuracy. The Granger selection method (GSM) establishes a causal matrix of all features by performing excessively time; however, it cannot achieve a high prediction accuracy and only forecasts fixed multivariate time series data. To address these issues, we proposed an online CFS for streaming features (OCFSSFs) that mine MB containing PC and spouse and adopt the interleaving PC and spouse learning method. Furthermore, it distinguishes between PC and spouse in real time and can identify children with parents online when identifying spouses. We experimentally evaluated the proposed algorithm on synthetic datasets using precision, recall, and distance. In addition, the algorithm was tested on real-world and time series datasets using classification precision, the number of selected features, and running time. The results validated the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm."

Immunotherapy, particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), has revolutionized the management of NSCLC, but response rates are highly variable. Identifying reliable predictive biomarkers is crucial to optimize patient selection and treatment outcomes. This systematic review aimed to evaluate the current state of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) applications in predicting the response to immunotherapy in NSCLC. A comprehensive literature search identified 19 studies that met the inclusion criteria. The studies employed diverse AI/ML techniques, including deep learning, artificial neural networks, support vector machines, and gradient boosting methods, applied to various data modalities such as medical imaging, genomic data, clinical variables, and immunohistochemical markers. Several studies demonstrated the ability of AI/ML models to accurately predict immunotherapy response, progression-free survival, and overall survival in NSCLC patients. However, challenges remain in data availability, quality, and interpretability of these models. Efforts have been made to develop interpretable AI/ML techniques, but further research is needed to improve transparency and explainability. Additionally, translating AI/ML models from research settings to clinical practice poses challenges related to regulatory approval, data privacy, and integration into existing healthcare systems. Nonetheless, the successful implementation of AI/ML models could enable personalized treatment strategies, improve treatment outcomes, and reduce unnecessary toxicities and healthcare costs associated with ineffective treatments."

A considerable proportion of promising drugs identified in phase II trials fail the confirmative efficacy test in phase III. Recognizing the low posterior probabilities ofH(1)when accepting the drug under Simon's two-stage design, the Bayesian enhancement two-stage (BET) design is proposed to strengthen the passing criterion. Under the BET design, the lengths of highest posterior density (HPD) intervals, posterior probabilities ofH(0)andH(1)are computed to calibrate the design parameters, aiming to improve the stability of the trial characteristics and strengthen the evidence for proceeding the drug development forward. However, from a practical perspective, the HPD interval length lacks transparency and interpretability. To circumvent this problem, we propose the BET design with error control (BETEC) by replacing the HPD interval length with the posterior error rate. The BETEC design can achieve a balance between the posterior false positive rate and false negative rate and, more importantly, it has an intuitive and clear interpretation. We compare our method with the BET design and Simon's design through extensive simulation studies. As an illustration, we further apply BETEC to two recent clinical trials, and investigate its performance in comparison with other competitive designs. Being both efficient and intuitive, the BETEC design can serve as an alternative toolbox for implementing phase II single-arm trials."

In derivation cohort, radiomics and clinical-radiomics models for ER prediction were constructed by LightGBM (a machine learning algorithm). A clinical model was also developed for comparison. Model performance was validated in internal and two external cohorts by ROC. In addition, we investigated the interpretability of the LightGBM model.ResultsThe combined clinical-radiomics model that included 15 radiomic features and 3 clinical features (CA19-9 > 1000 U/ml, vascular invasion and tumor margin), resulting in the area under the curves (AUCs) of 0.974 (95% CI 0.946-1.000) in the derivation cohort, and 0.871-0.882 (95% CI 0.672-0.962) in the internal and external validation cohorts, respectively, which are higher than the AJCC 8th TNM staging system (AUCs: 0.686-0.717, p all < 0.05). Especially, the sensitivity of this machine learning model could reach 94.6% on average for all the cohorts.ConclusionsThis AI-driven combined radiomics model may provide as a useful tool to preoperatively predict ER and improve therapeutic management of ICC patients."

However, the acceptance of these Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems in real clinical setups is severely limited primarily because their decision-making process remains largely obscure. This work aims at elucidating a deep learning based medical image classifier by verifying that the model learns and utilizes similar disease-related concepts as described and employed by dermatologists. We used a well-trained and high performing neural network developed by REasoning for COmplex Data (RECOD) Lab for classification of three skin tumours, i.e. Melanocytic Naevi, Melanoma and Seborrheic Keratosis and performed a detailed analysis on its latent space. Two well established and publicly available skin disease datasets, PH2 and derm7pt, are used for experimentation. Human understandable concepts are mapped to RECOD image classification model with the help of Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs), introducing a novel training and significance testing paradigm for CAVs. Our results on an independent evaluation set clearly shows that the classifier learns and encodes human understandable concepts in its latent representation. Additionally, TCAV scores (Testing with CAVs) suggest that the neural network indeed makes use of disease-related concepts in the correct way when making predictions. We anticipate that this work can not only increase confidence of medical practitioners on CAD but also serve as a stepping stone for further development of CAV-based neural network interpretation methods."

Survival Kernets: Scalable and Interpretable Deep Kernel Survival Analysis with an Accuracy Guarantee	JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH			English	Article						survival analysis; kernel methods; neural networks; scalability; interpretability	K-MEANS; CANCER; COMORBIDITY; CONSISTENCY; FRAMEWORK; SYSTEM; INDEX; AGE	"Kernel survival analysis models estimate individual survival distributions with the help of a kernel function, which measures the similarity between any two data points. Such a kernel function can be learned using deep kernel survival models. In this paper, we present a new deep kernel survival model called a survival kernet, which scales to large datasets in a manner that is amenable to model interpretation and also theoretical analysis. Specifically, the training data are partitioned into clusters based on a recently developed training set compression scheme for classification and regression called kernel netting that we extend to the survival analysis setting. At test time, each data point is represented as a weighted combination of these clusters, and each such cluster can be visualized. For a special case of survival kernets, we establish a finite-sample error bound on predicted survival distributions that is, up to a log factor, optimal. Whereas scalability at test time is achieved using the aforementioned kernel netting compression strategy, scalability during training is achieved by a warm-start procedure based on tree ensembles such as XGBOOST and a heuristic approach to accelerating neural architecture search. On four standard survival analysis datasets of varying sizes (up to roughly 3 million data points), we show that survival kernets are highly competitive compared to various baselines tested in terms of time-dependent concordance index.

RCAD (radiomics-based computer-aided diagnosis) has proven to be helpful and provide interpretability in clinical use. OBJECTIVE: This work aims to develop a CT-based radiomics signature and investigate its correlation with malignant/benign liver tumors. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 168 patients of hepatocellular carcinoma (malignant) and 117 patients of hepatic hemangioma (benign). Texture features were extracted from plain CT images and used as candidate features. A radiomics signaturewas developed from the candidate features. We performed logistic regression analysis and used a multiple-regression coefficient (termed as R) to assess the correlation between the developed radiomics signature and malignant/benign liver tumors. Finally, we built a logistic regression model to classify benign and malignant liver tumors. RESULTS: Thirteen features were chosen from 1223 candidate features to constitute the radiomics signature. The logistic regression analysis achieved an R = 0.6745, which was much larger than R-alpha = 0.3703 (the critical value of R at significant level alpha = 0.001). The logistic regression model achieved an average AUC of 0.87. CONCLUSIONS: The developed radiomics signature was statistically significantly correlated with malignant/benign liver tumors (p < 0.001). It has potential to help enhance physicians' diagnostic abilities and play an important role in RCADs."

CD is a complex disorder whose development is affected by genetics (HLA alleles) and gluten ingestion. The celiac patients who are not treated are at a high risk of cancer, malignant lymphoma, and small bowel neoplasia. Therefore, CD diagnosis and grading are of paramount importance. The proposed FCM models human thinking for the purpose of classifying patients suffering from CD. We used the latest grading method where three grades A, B1, and B2 are used. To improve FCM efficiency and classification capability, a nonlinear Hebbian learning algorithm is applied for adjusting the FCM weights. To this end, 89 cases are studied. Three experts extracted seven main determinant characteristics of CD which were considered as FCM concepts. The mutual effects of these concepts on one another and on the final concept were expressed in the form of fuzzy rules and linguistic variables. Using the center of gravity defuzzifier, we obtained the numerical values of these weights and obtained the total weight matrix. Ultimately, combining the FCM model with PFCM algorithm, we obtained the grades A, B1, and B2 accuracies as 88, 90, and 91%, respectively. The main advantage of the proposed FCM is the good transparency and interpretability in the decision-making procedure, which make it a suitable tool for daily usage in the clinical practice."

This revised terminology now includes the different possible colposcopic aspects of the normal cervix, including the ectropion and the normal transformation zone. It also includes colposcopic appearance of abnormal glandular cervical epithelium and of vaginal epithelium. The revised nomenclature was reviewed by all the board of the SFCPCV and was finally approved during the 45th annual conference of the SFCPCV.Results. - Abnormal transformation zone grade (TAG) 1a and 1b have been brought together under the sole TAG1 designation. TAG2a and TAG2b now correspond to TAG2, whereas TAG2c corresponds to TAG3. Colposcopic report should mention the interpretability of the colposcopic examination, with the precise type of the squamocolumnar junction (1, 2 or 3), the colposcopic impression, the size of any TAG and finally mention whether one or multiple biopsies were taken and their precise location. Colposcopic impression must give priority to the most pejorative colposcopic aspect which takes precedence over others.Conclusion. - When performing colposcopy, one should keep in mind that this examination only relies on the interpretation of various colposcopic signs and images with this not guaranteeing for diagnosis.

In the recent past, a significant amount of multi-omics data derived from cancer patients has emerged. However, a robust framework for integrating multi-omics data types to efficiently and precisely subgroup glioma patients and predict survival prognosis is still lacking. In addition, effective therapeutic targets for treating glioma patients with poor prognoses are in dire need. To begin to resolve this difficulty, we developed i-Modern, an integrated Multi-omics deep learning network method, and optimized a sophisticated computational model in gliomas that can accurately stratify patients based on their prognosis. We built a survival-associated predictive framework integrating transcription profile, miRNA expression, somatic mutations, copy number variation (CNV), DNA methylation, and protein expression. This framework achieved promising performance in distinguishing high-risk glioma patients from those with good prognoses. Furthermore, we constructed multiple fully connected neural networks that are trained on prioritized multi-omics signatures or even only potential single-omics signatures, based on our customized scoring system. Together, the landmark multi-omics signatures we identified may serve as potential therapeutic targets in gliomas. (c) 2022 The Authors.

The objective is to find linear combinations of the variables in each data set having maximal correlation. In genomics, CCA has become increasingly important to estimate the associations between gene expression data and DNA copy number change data. The identification of such associations might help to increase our understanding of the development of diseases such as cancer. However, these data sets are typically high-dimensional, containing a lot of variables relative to the number of objects. Moreover, the data sets might contain atypical observations since it is likely that objects react differently to treatments. We discuss a method for Robust Sparse CCA, thereby providing a solution to both issues. Sparse estimation produces canonical vectors with some of their elements estimated as exactly zero. As such, their interpretability is improved. Robust methods can cope with atypical observations in the data. Results: We illustrate the good performance of the Robust Sparse CCA method by several simulation studies and three biometric examples. Robust Sparse CCA considerably outperforms its main alternatives in (1) correctly detecting the main associations between the data sets, in (2) accurately estimating these associations, and in (3) detecting outliers. Conclusions: Robust Sparse CCA delivers interpretable canonical vectors, while at the same time coping with outlying observations. The proposed method is able to describe the associations between high-dimensional data sets, which are nowadays commonplace in genomics. Furthermore, the Robust Sparse CCA method allows to characterize outliers."

Such multivariate longitudinal data from couples may exhibit multi-faceted correlations that can be further complicated if there are polygamous partnerships. An example is data from cohort studies on human papillomavirus (HPV) transmission dynamics in heterosexual couples. HPV is a common sexually transmitted disease with 14 known oncogenic types causing anogenital cancers. The binary outcomes on the multiple types measured in couples over time may introduce inter-type, intra-couple, and temporal correlations. Simple analysis using generalized estimating equations or random effects models lacks interpretability and cannot fully use the available information. We developed a hybrid modeling strategy using Markov transition models together with pairwise composite likelihood for analyzing such data. The method can be used to identify risk factors associated with HPV transmission and persistence, estimate difference in risks between male-to-female and female-to-male HPV transmission, compare type-specific transmission risks within couples, and characterize the inter-type and intra-couple associations. Applying the method to HPV couple data collected in a Ugandan male circumcision (MC) trial, we assessed the effect of MC and the role of gender on risks of HPV transmission and persistence.

Herein we demonstrate the potential value of a novel radiomics-based approach for the classification of screen-detected indeterminate nodules. Material and methods Independent quantitative variables assessing various radiologic nodule features such as sphericity, flatness, elongation, spiculation, lobulation and curvature were developed from the NLST dataset using 726 indeterminate nodules (all >= 7 mm, benign, n = 318 and malignant, n = 408). Multivariate analysis was performed using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method for variable selection and regularization in order to enhance the prediction accuracy and interpretability of the multivariate model. The bootstrapping method was then applied for the internal validation and the optimism-corrected AUC was reported for the final model. Results Eight of the originally considered 57 quantitative radiologic features were selected by LASSO multivariate modeling. These 8 features include variables capturing Location: vertical location (Offset carina centroid z), Size: volume estimate (Minimum enclosing brick), Shape: flatness, Density: texture analysis (Score Indicative of Lesion/Lung Aggression/ Abnormality (SILA) texture), and surface characteristics: surface complexity (Maximum shape index and Average shape index), and estimates of surface curvature (Average positive mean curvature and Minimum mean curvature), all with P<0.01. The optimism-corrected AUC for these 8 features is 0.939. Conclusions Our novel radiomic LDCT-based approach for indeterminate screen-detected nodule characterization appears extremely promising however independent external validation is needed."

However, the molecular mechanism of pancancer metastasis is very unclear, and identification methods for pancancer metastasis-related genes are still lacking. In view of this research status, we developed a novel pipeline to identify pancancer metastasis-related genes based on compound constrained nonnegative matrix factorization (CCNMF). To solve the above problems, the following modules were designed. A correntropy operator and feature similarity fusion (FSF) were first adopted to process the multiomics features of genes; thus, the influences caused by irrelevant biomolecular patterns, manifested as non-Gaussian noise, were minimized. CCNMF was then adopted to handle the above features with compound constraints consisting of a gene relation network and a metastasis-relatedgene set, which maximizes the biological interpretability of the metafeatures generated by NMF. Since a negative set of pancancer metastasis-relatedgenes could hardly be obtained, semisupervised analyses were performed on gene features acquired by each step in our pipeline to examine our method's effect. 83% of the 236 candidates identified by the above method were associated with the metastasis of one or more cancers, 71.9% candidates were identified immune-related in pancancer in addition to the hallmark genes. Our study provides an effective and interpretable method for identifying metastasis-related as well as immune-related genes, and the method is successfully applied to TCGA pancancer data."

Sometimes it is required to clearly explain the classification process of a model's predictions. Models which are inherently easier to interpret can be effortlessly related to the context of the problem, and their predictions can be, if necessary, ethically and legally evaluated. In this paper, we propose a novel method to generate rule-based classifiers from categorical data that can be readily interpreted. Classifiers are generated using a multi-objective optimization approach focusing on two main objectives: maximizing the performance of the learned classifier and minimizing its number of rules. The multi-objective evolutionary algorithms ENORA and NSGA-II have been adapted to optimize the performance of the classifier based on three different machine learning metrics: accuracy, area under the ROC curve, and root mean square error. We have extensively compared the generated classifiers using our proposed method with classifiers generated using classical methods such as PART, JRip, OneR and ZeroR. The experiments have been conducted in full training mode, in 10-fold cross-validation mode, and in train/test splitting mode. To make results reproducible, we have used the well-known and publicly available datasets Breast Cancer, Monk's Problem 2, Tic-Tac-Toe-Endgame, Car, kr-vs-kp and Nursery. After performing an exhaustive statistical test on our results, we conclude that the proposed method is able to generate highly accurate and easy to interpret classification models."

Materials and Methods: This retrospective study included patients who underwent a radiologic study between 2005 and 2020 at an outpatient imaging facility. Key images and associated labels from the studies were retrospectively extracted from the original study interpretation. These images were used for RadImageNet model training with random weight initiation. The RadImageNet models were compared with ImageNet models using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for eight classification tasks and using Dice scores for two segmentation problems. Results: The RadImageNet database consists of 1.35 million annotated medical images in 131 872 patients who underwent CT, MRI, and US for musculoskeletal, neurologic, oncologic, gastrointestinal, endocrine, abdominal, and pulmonary pathologic conditions. For transfer learning tasks on small datasets-thyroid nodules (US), breast masses (US), anterior cruciate ligament injuries (MRI), and meniscal tears (MRI)-the RadImageNet models demonstrated a significant advantage (P < .001) to ImageNet models (9.4%, 4.0%, 4.8%, and 4.5% AUC improvements, respectively). For larger datasets-pneumonia (chest radiography), COVID-19 (CT), SARS-CoV-2 (CT), and intracranial hemorrhage (CT)-the RadImageNet models also illustrated improved AUC (P < .001) by 1.9%, 6.1%, 1.7%, and 0.9%, respectively. Additionally, lesion localizations of the RadImageNet models were improved by 64.6% and 16.4% on thyroid and breast US datasets, respectively. Conclusion: RadImageNet pretrained models demonstrated better interpretability compared with ImageNet models, especially for smaller radiologic datasets."

Artificial intelligence for prediction of biological activities and generation of molecular hits using stereochemical information	JOURNAL OF COMPUTER-AIDED MOLECULAR DESIGN			English	Article						Deep reinforcement learning; De novo drug design; Attention mechanism; Stereochemical information; Interpretability	DRUG DISCOVERY; CANCER	"In this work, we develop a method for generating targeted hit compounds by applying deep reinforcement learning and attention mechanisms to predict binding affinity against a biological target while considering stereochemical information. The novelty of this work is a deep model Predictor that can establish the relationship between chemical structures and their corresponding pIC(50) values. We thoroughly study the effect of different molecular descriptors such as ECFP4, ECFP6, SMILES and RDKFingerprint. Also, we demonstrated the importance of attention mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies in molecular sequences. Due to the importance of stereochemical information for the binding mechanism, this information was employed both in the prediction and generation processes. To identify the most promising hits, we apply the self-adaptive multi-objective optimization strategy. Moreover, to ensure the existence of stereochemical information, we consider all the possible enumerated stereoisomers to provide the most appropriate 3D structures. We evaluated this approach against the Ubiquitin-Specific Protease 7 (USP7) by generating putative inhibitors for this target. The predictor with SMILES notations as descriptor plus bidirectional recurrent neural network using attention mechanism has the best performance. Additionally, our methodology identify the regions of the generated molecules that are important for the interaction with the receptor's active site. Also, the obtained results demonstrate that it is possible to discover synthesizable molecules with high biological affinity for the target, containing the indication of their optimal stereochemical conformation."

This transformation can lead to vision loss, metastasis, and even death. Early prediction of UM can reduce the risk of death. In this study, we employed transfer learning techniques and four convolutional neural network (CNN)-based architectures to detect UM and enhance the interpretation of diagnostic results. To accomplish this, we manually gathered 854 RGB fundus images from two distinct datasets, representing the right and left eyes of 854 unique patients (427 lesions and 427 non-lesions). Preprocessing steps, such as image conversion, resizing, and data augmentation, were performed before training and validating the classification results. We utilized InceptionV3, Xception, DenseNet121, and DenseNet169 pre-trained models to improve the generalizability and performance of our results, evaluating each architecture on an external validation set. Addressing the issue of interpretability in deep learning (DL) models to minimize the blackbox problem, we employed the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis approach to identify regions of an eye image that contribute most to the prediction of choroidal nevus (CN). The performance results of the DL models revealed that DenseNet169 achieved the highest accuracy 89%, and lowest loss value 0.65%, for the binary classification of CN. The SHAP findings demonstrate that this method can serve as a tool for interpreting classification results by providing additional context information about individual sample images and facilitating a more comprehensive evaluation of binary classification in CN."

However, the effectiveness of TCM treatment depends more on the personal experience of doctors, and the standardization of TCM prescriptions needs to be strengthened. In this study, we use TCM clinical prescriptions to train a standardized TCM prescription generation model to provide an auxiliary prescription reference for physicians. However, in our initial experiments, we found two severe problems in the dataset. The first problem is a strong correlation between each herb; for instance, some herbs often appear together to treat specific symptoms. The second is a severe class imbalance within each label, a few herbs always appear in most prescriptions, but most herbs have a low frequency of occurrence in the total dataset. To solve the correlation between each herb label, we adopt the Bayes Classifier Chain(BCC) algorithm, whose basic classifier is Cost-Sensitive SVM targeted to the class imbalance of the label. Based on this, we also improve the BCC method according to the characteristics of TCM prescription dataset. In our BCC classifier, the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) construction method has high interpretability in the scenario of TCM prescription. After combining multi-label learning algorithms with several SVM algorithms and comparing their performance in detail, we find that BBC+CS-SVM best deals with class imbalance within the label in multi-label classification problems."

It is also critical to develop a tool for investigating co-occurrence networks and differential abundance analyses to reveal the disease-related taxa-taxa relationship. In addition, it is also necessary to tighten the co-occurrence network into smaller modules to increase the ability for functional annotation and interpretability of these taxa-taxa relationships. Also, it is critical to retain the phylogenetic relationship among the taxa to identify differential abundance patterns, which can be used to resolve contradicting functions reported by different studies. Results In this article, we present Correlation and Consensus-based Cross-taxonomy Network Analysis (C3NA), a user-friendly R package for investigating compositional microbial sequencing data to identify and compare co-occurrence patterns across different taxonomic levels. C3NA contains two interactive graphic user interfaces (Shiny applications), one of them dedicated to the comparison between two diagnoses, e.g., disease versus control. We used C3NA to analyze two well-studied diseases, colorectal cancer, and Crohn's disease. We discovered clusters of study and disease-dependent taxa that overlap with known functional taxa studied by other discovery studies and differential abundance analyses. Conclusion C3NA offers a new microbial data analyses pipeline for refined and enriched taxa-taxa co-occurrence network analyses, and the usability was further expanded via the built-in Shiny applications for interactive investigation."

An alternative is the difference in restricted mean times lost (RMTL), which gives the mean time lost to a specific cause of failure between treatment groups. In non-randomized studies, the average causal effect is conventionally used for decision-making about treatment and public health policies. We show how the difference in RMTL can be estimated by contrasting the integrated cumulative incidence functions from a Fine-Gray model. We also show how the difference in RMTL can be estimated by using inverse probability of treatment weighting and contrasts between weighted non-parametric estimators of the area below the cumulative incidence. We use pseudo-observation approaches to estimate both component models and we integrate them into a doubly-robust estimator. We demonstrate that this estimator is consistent when either component is correctly specified. We conduct simulation studies to assess its finite-sample performance and demonstrate its inherited consistency property from its component models. We also examine the performance of this estimator under varying degrees of covariate overlap and under a model misspecification of nonlinearity. We apply the proposed method to assess biomarker-treatment interaction in subpopulations of the POPLAR and OAK randomized controlled trials of second-line therapy for advanced non-small-cell lung cancer."

Existing solutions are mostly based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which require a large amount of training data. Most of the developed CNN models are based only on the main nodule region, without considering the surrounding tissues. Obtaining high sensitivity is challenging with lung nodule malignancy prediction. Moreover, the interpretability of the proposed techniques should be a consideration when the end goal is to utilize the model in a clinical setting. Capsule networks (CapsNets) are new and revolutionary machine learning architectures proposed to overcome shortcomings of CNNs. Capitalizing on the success of CapsNet in biomedical domains, we propose a novel model for lung tumor malignancy prediction. The proposed framework, referred to as the 3D Multi-scale Capsule Network (3D-MCN), is uniquely designed to benefit from: (i) 3D inputs, providing information about the nodule in 3D; (ii) Multi-scale input, capturing the nodule's local features, as well as the characteristics of the surrounding tissues, and; (iii) CapsNet-based design, being capable of dealing with a small number of training samples. The proposed 3D-MCN architecture predicted lung nodule malignancy with a high accuracy of 93.12%, sensitivity of 94.94%, area under the curve (AUC) of 0.9641, and specificity of 90% when tested on the LIDC-IDRI dataset. When classifying patients as having a malignant condition (i.e., at least one malignant nodule is detected) or not, the proposed model achieved an accuracy of 83%, and a sensitivity and specificity of 84% and 81% respectively."

MDA reacts with acetaldehyde to form malondialdehyde-modified low-density lipoprotein (MDA-LDL). We studied unsettled issues in the association between MDA-LDL and the pathophysiology of ASD in 18 individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and eight age-matched controls. Social behaviors were assessed using the social responsiveness scale (SRS). To overcome the problem of using small samples, adaptive Lasso was used to enhance the interpretability accuracy, and a coefficient of variation was used for variable selections. Plasma levels of the MDA-LDL levels (91.00 +/- 16.70 vs. 74.50 +/- 18.88) and the DHA/arachidonic acid (ARA) ratio (0.57 +/- 0.16 vs. 0.37 +/- 0.07) were significantly higher and the superoxide dismutase levels were significantly lower in the ASD group than those in the control group. Total SRS scores in the ASD group were significantly higher than those in the control group. The unbeneficial DHA/ARA ratio induced ferroptosis via lipid peroxidation. Multiple linear regression analysis and adaptive Lasso revealed an association of the DHA/ARA ratio with total SRS scores and increased MDA-LDL levels in plasma, resulting in neuronal deficiencies. This unbeneficial DHA/ARA-ratio-induced ferroptosis contributes to autistic social behaviors and is available for therapy."

The writer states in his Letter to the Editor that the findings in our publication are not interpretable and/or cannot be generalized due to the lack of understanding of the source mine and bulk content of the cosmetic talc used in the facial makeups. In brief, we performed an exposure simulation study using established industrial hygiene methods, planned and conducted by Certified Industrial Hygienists (CIHs), to assess asbestos exposures during the use of facial makeups that were found to contain very low levels of asbestos below the conventional detection limits of X-ray diffraction and polarized light microscopy. In total, 54 personal air samples and 72 area samples were collected from six different products. Out of the 126 samples collected and analyzed, asbestos was only found in eight samples (five personal samples and three area samples). A 95th percentile 24-h time-weighted average (TWA) result of 0.00008 fibers/cubic centimeter was calculated based on censored data and an assumed three applications per day. We believe these results may be of utility to understand the risk of low-level asbestos content in facial makeups regardless of source or bulk content, as described in our study, and do not find the writer's assertion of generalizability or interpretability to be compelling reasons not to apply our results, as is, for prospective purposes."

The growth of omics databases is creating a considerable potential for knowledge discovery and, concomitantly, is bringing new challenges to statistical learning and computational biology for health applications. Indeed, the high dimensionality of these data may hamper the use of traditional regression methods and parameter estimation algorithms due to the intrinsic non-identifiability of the inherent optimization problem. Regularized optimization has been rising as a promising and useful strategy to solve these ill-posed problems by imposing additional constraints in the solution parameter space. In particular, the field of statistical learning with sparsity has been significantly contributing to building accurate models that also bring interpretability to biological observations and phenomena. Beyond the now-classic elastic net, one of the best-known methods that combine lasso with ridge penalizations, we briefly overview recent literature on structured regularizers and penalty functions that have been applied in biomedical data to build parsimonious models in a variety of underlying contexts, from survival to generalized linear models. These methods include functions of l(k)-norms and network-based penalties that take into account the inherent relationships between the features.

It is crucial to rationally fuse the complementary information in multi-modality PET/CT segmentation. However, existing methods usually lack interpretability and fail to sufficiently identify and aggregate critical information from different modalities. In this study, we proposed a novel segmentation framework that incorporated an interpretation module into the multi-modality segmentation backbone. The interpretation module highlighted critical features from each modality based on their contributions to the segmentation performance. To provide explicit supervision for the interpretation module, we introduced a novel interpretation loss with two fusion schemes: strengthened fusion and perturbed fusion. The interpretation loss guided the interpretation module to focus on informative features, enhancing its effectiveness in generating meaningful interpretable masks. Under the guidance of the interpretation module, the proposed approach can fully exploit meaningful features from each modality, leading to better integration of multi-modality information and improved segmentation performance. Ablative and comparative experiments were conducted on two PET/CT tumor segmentation datasets. The proposed approach surpassed the baseline by 1.4 and 1.8 Dices on two datasets, respectively, indicating the improvement achieved by the interpretation method. Furthermore, the proposed approach outperformed the best comparison approach by 0.9 and 0.6 Dices on two datasets, respectively. In addition, visualization and perturbation experiments further illustrated the effectiveness of the interpretation method in highlighting critical features."

Their purpose is to give context to the affected metabolites in terms of the prior knowledge contained in metabolic pathways. However, the interpretation of a prioritized pathway list is still challenging, as pathways show overlap and cross talk effects.ResultsWe introduce FELLA, an R package to perform a network-based enrichment of a list of affected metabolites. FELLA builds a hierarchical representation of an organism biochemistry from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), containing pathways, modules, enzymes, reactions and metabolites. In addition to providing a list of pathways, FELLA reports intermediate entities (modules, enzymes, reactions) that link the input metabolites to them. This sheds light on pathway cross talk and potential enzymes or metabolites as targets for the condition under study. FELLA has been applied to six public datasets -three from Homo sapiens, two from Danio rerio and one from Mus musculus- and has reproduced findings from the original studies and from independent literature.ConclusionsThe R package FELLA offers an innovative enrichment concept starting from a list of metabolites, based on a knowledge graph representation of the KEGG database that focuses on interpretability. Besides reporting a list of pathways, FELLA suggests intermediate entities that are of interest per se. Its usefulness has been shown at several molecular levels on six public datasets, including human and animal models. The user can run the enrichment analysis through a simple interactive graphical interface or programmatically. FELLA is publicly available in Bioconductor under the GPL-3 license."

Previously, it was shown that a mimotope library reflecting the public IgM repertoire of healthy donors (IgM IgOme) can be mined for efficient probes of tumor biomarker antibody reactivities. To better explore the interpretability of this approach for IgM, solid tumor-related profiles of IgM reactivities to linear epitopes of actual tumor antigens and viral epitopes were studied. The probes were designed as oriented planar microarrays of 4526 peptide sequences (as overlapping 15-mers) derived from 24 tumor-associated antigens and 209 cancer-related B cell epitopes from 30 viral antigens. The IgM reactivity in sera from 21 patients with glioblastoma multiforme, brain metastases of other tumors, and non-tumor-bearing neurosurgery patients was thus probed in a proof-of-principle study. A graph representation of the binding data was developed, which mapped the cross-reactivity of the mixture of IgM (poly)specificities, delineating different antibody footprints in the features of the graph-neighborhoods and cliques. The reactivity graph mapped the major features of the IgM repertoire such as the magnitude of the reactivity (titer) and major cross-reactivities, which correlated with blood group reactivity, non-self recognition, and even idiotypic specificities. A correlation between an aspect of this image of the IgM IgOme, namely, small cliques reflecting rare self-reactivities and the capacity of subsets of the epitopes to separate the diagnostic groups studied was found. In this way, the graph representation helped the feature selection in its filtering step and provided reduced feature sets, which, after recursive feature elimination, produced a classifier containing 51 peptide reactivities separating the three diagnostic groups with an unexpected efficiency. Thus, IgM IgOme approaches to repertoire studies is greatly augmented when self/viral antigens are used and the data are represented as a reactivity graph. This approach is most general, and if it is applicable to tumors in immunologically privileged sites, it can be applied to any solid tumors, for instance, breast or lung cancer."

The primary tumor can be large and asymmetrical, and multiple organs at risk (OARs) with varying dose-sparing goals lie close to the target volume. Currently, there is no systematic way of automating the generation of IMRT plans, and the manual options face planning quality and long planning time challenges. In this article, we present a reinforcement learning (RL) model for the purposes of providing automated treatment planning to reduce clinical workflow time as well as providing a better starting point for human planners to modify and build upon. Several models with progressing complexity are presented, including the relevant plan dosimetry analysis and model interpretations of the resulting strategies learned by the auto-planning agent. Models were trained on a set of 40 patients and validated on a set of 20 patients. The presented models are shown to be consistent with the requirements of an RL model to be underpinned by a Markov decision process (MDP). In-depth interpretability of the models is presented by examination of the decision space using action hyperplanes. The auto-planning agent was able to generate plans with superior reduction in the mean dose of the left and right parotid glands by approximately 7 Gy +/-+/- 2.5 Gy (p < 0.01) over a starting, static template plan with only pre-defined general prescription information. RL plans were comparable to a human expert's clinical plans for the primary (44 Gy), boost (26 Gy) , and the summed plans (70 Gy) with p-values of 0.43, 0.72, and 0.67, respectively, for the dosimetric endpoints and uniform target coverage normalization. The RL planning agent was able to produce the plans used in validation in an average of 13.58 min, with a minimum and a maximum planning time of 2.27 and 44.82 min, respectively."

Histology image analysis is a crucial diagnostic step in staging and treatment planning, especially for cancerous lesions. With the increasing adoption of computational methods for image analysis, significant strides are being made to improve the performance metrics of image segmentation and classification frameworks. However, many developed frameworks effectively function as black boxes, granting minimal context to the decision-making process. Thus, there is a need to develop methods that offer reasonable discriminatory power and a biologically-informed intuition to the decision-making process. Approach. In this study, we utilized and modified a discriminative feature-based dictionary learning (DFDL) paradigm to generate a classification framework that allows for discrimination between two distinct clinical histologies. This framework allows us (i) to discriminate between 2 clinically distinct diseases or histologies and (ii) provides interpretable group-specific representative dictionary image patches, or 'atoms', generated during classifier training. This implementation is performed on multiplexed immunofluorescence images from two separate patient cohorts- a pancreatic cohort consisting of cancerous and non-cancerous tissues and a metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (mNSCLC) cohort of responders and non-responders to an immunotherapeutic treatment regimen. The analysis was done at both the image-level and subject-level. Five cell types were selected, namely, epithelial cells, cytotoxic lymphocytes, antigen presenting cells, HelperT cells, and T-regulatory cells, as our phenotypes of interest. Results. We showed that DFDL had significant discriminant capabilities for both the pancreatic pathologies cohort (subject-level AUC-0.8878) and the mNSCLC immunotherapy response cohort (subject-level AUC-0.7221). The secondary analysis also showed that more than 50% of the obtained dictionary atoms from the classifier contained biologically relevant information. Significance. Our method shows that the generated dictionary features can help distinguish patients presenting two different histologies with strong sensitivity and specificity metrics. These features allow for an additional layer of model interpretability, a highly desirable element in clinical applications for identifying novel biological phenomena."

Materials and Methods: A preclinical chest computed tomography (CT) trial was performedwith a human cadaverwithout known lung diseasewith incremental radiation dose using tin filter-based spectral shaping protocols. A subset of protocols for full diagnostic evaluation of HR, PN, and ID structures was translated to clinical routine. Also, a minimum diagnostic radiation dose protocol was defined (MIN). These protocols were prospectively applied over 5 months in the clinical routine under consideration of the individual clinical indication. We compared radiation dose parameters, objective and subjective image quality (IQ). Results: The HR protocolwas performed in 38 patients (43%), PN in 21 patients (24%), ID in 20 patients (23%), andMIN in 9 patients (10%). Radiation dose differed significantly among HR, PN, and ID (5.4, 1.2, and 0.6 mGy, respectively; P < 0.001). Differences between ID and MIN (0.2 mGy) were not significant (P = 0.262). Dose-normalized contrast-to-noise ratio was comparable among all groups (P = 0.087). Overall IQ was perfect for the HR protocol (median, 5.0) and decreased for PN (4.5), ID-CT (4.3), and MIN-CT (2.5). The delineation of disease-specific findings was high in all dedicated protocols (HR, 5.0; PN, 5.0; ID, 4.5). The MIN protocol had borderline IQ for PN and ID lesions but was insufficient for HR structures. The dose reductions were 78% (PN), 89% (ID), and 97% (MIN) compared with the HR protocols. Conclusions: Personalized chest CT tailored to the clinical indications leads to substantial dose reduction without reducing interpretability. More than 50% of patients can benefit from such individual adaptation in a clinical routine setting. Personalized radiation dose adjustments with validated diagnostic IQ are especially preferable for evaluating ID and PN lesions."

However, the interpretability of the model-based results has not been adequately addressed by existing methods. This phenomenon is directly manifested by a significant bias in the representation of feature localization. Good recognition models experience severe feature localization errors, particularly for lesions with subtle morphological features, and such unsatisfactory performance hinders the clinical deployment of models. To effectively alleviate this problem, we proposed a solution to optimize the localization bias in feature representations of cancer-related recognition models that is difficult to accurately label and identify in clinical practice. Optimization was performed in the training phase of the model through the proposed data augmentation method and auxiliary loss function based on clinical priors. The data augmentation method, called partial jigsaw, can break the spatial structure of lesion-independent image blocks and enrich the data feature space to decouple the interference of background features on the space and focus on fine-grained lesion features. The annotation-based auxiliary loss function used class activation maps for sample distribution correction and led the model to present localization representation converging on the gold standard annotation of visualization maps. The results show that with the improvement of our method, the precision of model recognition reached an average of 92.79%, an F1-score of 92.61%, and accuracy of 95.56% based on a dataset constructed from 23 hospitals. In addition, we quantified the evaluation representation of visualization feature maps. The improved model yielded significant offset correction results for visualized feature maps compared with the baseline model. The average visualization-weighted positive coverage improved from 51.85% to 83.76%. The proposed approach did not change the deployment capability and inference speed of the original model and can be incorporated into any state-of-the-art neural network. It also shows the potential to provide more accurate localization inference results and assist in clinical examinations during endoscopies."

Each study was evaluated with the CLAIM checklist. The additional outcomes for which data were sought included measures of AI model performance (eg, area under the curve [AUC], sensitivity, specificity, free-response operating characteristic curves), training and validation and testing group sample size, AI approach, detection versus classification AI, public data set utilization, MRI sequences used, and definition of gold standard for ground truth. The percentage of CLAIM checklist fulfillment was used to stratify studies into quartiles. Wilcoxon's rank-sum test was used for pair-wise comparisons.Results: In all, 75 studies were identified, and 53 studies qualified for analysis. The original CLAIM items that most studies did not fulfill includes item 12 (77% no): de-identification methods; item 13 (68% no): handling missing data; item 15 (47% no): rationale for choosing ground truth reference standard; item 18 (55% no): measurements of inter-and intrareader variability; item 31 (60% no): inclusion of validated interpretability maps; item 37 (92% no): inclusion of failure analysis to elucidate AI model weaknesses. An AUC score versus percentage CLAIM fulfillment quartile revealed a significant difference of the mean AUC scores between quartile 1 versus quartile 2 (0.78 versus 0.86, P = .034) and quartile 1 versus quartile 4 (0.78 versus 0.89, P = .003) scores. Based on additional information and outcome metrics gathered in this study, additional measures of best practice are defined. These new items include disclosure of public dataset usage, ground truth definition in comparison to other referenced works in the defined task, and sample size power calculation.Conclusion: A large proportion of AI studies do not fulfill key items in CLAIM guidelines within their methods and results sections. The percentage of CLAIM checklist fulfillment is weakly associated with improved AI model performance. Additions or supplementations to CLAIM are recommended to improve publishing standards and aid reviewers in determining study rigor."

The occurrence of distant metastases (DM) limits the overall survival (OS) of patients with chondrosarcoma (CS). Early diagnosis and treatment of CS remains a great challenge in clinical practice. The aim of this study was to investigate metastatic factors and develop a risk stratification model for clinicians' decision making. Methods. Six machine learning (ML) algorithms, including logistic regression (LR), plain Bayesian classifier (NBC), decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), gradient boosting machine (GBM) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). A 10-fold cross validation was performed for each model separately, multicenter data was used as external validation, and the best (highest AUC) model was selected to build the network calculator. Results. A total of 1,385 patients met the inclusion criteria, including 82 (5.9%) patients with metastatic CS. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the risk of DM was significantly higher in patients with higher pathologic grades, T-stage, N stage, and non-left primary lesions, as well as those who did not receive surgery and chemotherapy. The AUC of the six ML algorithms for predicting DM ranged from 0.911-0.985, with the extreme gradient enhancement algorithm (XGBoost) having the highest AUC. Therefore, we used the XGB model and uploaded the results to an online risk calculator for estimating DM risk. Conclusions. In this study, combined with adequate SEER case database and external validation with data from multicenter institutions in different geographic regions, we confirmed that CS, T, N, laterality, and grading of surgery and chemotherapy were independent risk factors for DM. Based on the easily available clinical risk factors, machine learning algorithms built the XGB model that predicts the best outcome for DM. An online risk calculator helps simplify the patient assessment process and provides decision guidance for precision medicine and long-term cancer surveillance, which contributes to the interpretability of the model."

Accurately predicting disease prognosis remains a challenge given that the predictive value of several predictors remains controversial. Thus, we investigated whether machine learning (ML) approaches based on comprehensive predictors can predict the risk of structural recurrence for PTC patients. Methods A total of 2244 patients treated with thyroid surgery and radioiodine were included. Twenty-nine perioperative variables consisting of four dimensions (demographic characteristics and comorbidities, tumor-related variables, lymph node (LN)-related variables, and metabolic and inflammatory markers) were analyzed. We applied five ML algorithms-logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), random forest (RF), and neural network (NN)-to develop the models. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC-ROC) curve, calibration curve, and variable importance were used to evaluate the models' performance. Results During a median follow-up of 45.5 months, 179 patients (8.0%) experienced structural recurrence. The non-stimulated thyroglobulin, LN dissection, number of LNs dissected, lymph node metastasis ratio, N stage, comorbidity of hypertension, comorbidity of diabetes, body mass index, and low-density lipoprotein were used to develop the models. All models showed a greater AUC (AUC = 0.738 to 0.767) than did the ATA risk stratification (AUC = 0.620, DeLong test: P < 0.01). The SVM, XGBoost, and RF model showed greater sensitivity (0.568, 0.595, 0.676), specificity (0.903, 0.857, 0.784), accuracy (0.875, 0.835, 0.775), positive predictive value (PPV) (0.344, 0.272, 0.219), negative predictive value (NPV) (0.959, 0.959, 0.964), and F1 score (0.429, 0.373, 0.331) than did the ATA risk stratification (sensitivity = 0.432, specificity = 0.770, accuracy = 0.742, PPV = 0.144, NPV = 0.938, F1 score = 0.216). The RF model had generally consistent calibration compared with the other models. The Tg and the LNR were the top 2 important variables in all the models, the N stage was the top 5 important variables in all the models. Conclusions The RF model achieved the expected prediction performance with generally good discrimination, calibration and interpretability in this study. This study sheds light on the potential of ML approaches for improving the accuracy of risk stratification for PTC patients."

Currently, a pathologist's histological analysis of surgical specimens is necessary for a reliable assessment of pCR. Machine learning (ML) algorithms have the potential to be a non-invasive way for identifying appropriate candidates for non-operative therapy. However, these ML models' interpretability remains challenging. We propose using explainable boosting machine (EBM) to predict the pCR of RC patients following nCRT. MethodsA total of 296 features were extracted, including clinical parameters (CPs), dose-volume histogram (DVH) parameters from gross tumor volume (GTV) and organs-at-risk, and radiomics (R) and dosiomics (D) features from GTV. R and D features were subcategorized into shape (S), first-order (L1), second-order (L2), and higher-order (L3) local texture features. Multi-view analysis was employed to determine the best set of input feature categories. Boruta was used to select all-relevant features for each input dataset. ML models were trained on 180 cases from our institution, with 37 cases from RTOG 0822 clinical trial serving as the independent dataset for model validation. The performance of EBM in predicting pCR on the test dataset was evaluated using ROC AUC and compared with that of three state-of-the-art black-box models: extreme gradient boosting (XGB), random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM). The predictions of all black-box models were interpreted using Shapley additive explanations. ResultsThe best input feature categories were CP+DVH+S+R_L1+R_L2 for all models, from which Boruta-selected features enabled the EBM, XGB, RF, and SVM models to attain the AUCs of 0.820, 0.828, 0.828, and 0.774, respectively. Although EBM did not achieve the best performance, it provided the best capability for identifying critical turning points in response scores at distinct feature values, revealing that the bladder with maximum dose >50 Gy, and the tumor with maximum2DDiameterColumn >80 mm, elongation <0.55, leastAxisLength >50 mm and lower variance of CT intensities were associated with unfavorable outcomes. ConclusionsEBM has the potential to enhance the physician's ability to evaluate an ML-based prediction of pCR and has implications for selecting patients for a watchful waiting strategy to RC therapy."

DQB: A novel dynamic quantitive classification model using artificial bee colony algorithm with application on gene expression profiles	SAUDI JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						Classification rule; Artificial Bee Colony Algorithm; Quantitive rule-based classification model; Microarray; Gene expression profile; ABC; Cancer gene selection	MICROARRAY DATA; MOLECULAR CLASSIFICATION; PREDICTION; CANCER; DISCOVERY; SELECTION; TUMOR	"In the medical domain, it is very significant to develop a rule-based classification model. This is because it has the ability to produce a comprehensible and understandable model that accounts for the predictions. Moreover, it is desirable to know not only the classification decisions but also what leads to these decisions. In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic quantitative rule-based classification model, namely DQB, which integrates quantitative association rule mining and the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm to provide users with more convenience in terms of understandability and interpretability via an accurate class quantitative association rule-based classifier model. As far as we know, this is the first attempt to apply the ABC algorithm in mining for quantitative rule-based classifier models. In addition, this is the first attempt to use quantitative rule-based classification models for classifying microarray gene expression profiles. Also, in this research we developed a new dynamic local search strategy named DLS, which is improved the local search for artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm. The performance of the proposed model has been compared with well-known quantitative-based classification methods and bioinspired meta-heuristic classification algorithms, using six gene expression profiles for binary and multi-class cancer datasets. From the results, it can be concludes that a considerable increase in classification accuracy is obtained for the DQB when compared to other available algorithms in the literature, and it is able to provide an interpretable model for biologists. This confirms the significance of the proposed algorithm in the constructing a classifier rule-based model, and accordingly proofs that these rules obtain a highly qualified and meaningful knowledge extracted from the training set, where all subset of quantitive rules report close to 100% classification accuracy with a minimum number of genes. It is remarkable that apparently (to the best of our knowledge) several new genes were discovered that have not been seen in any past studies.

J	"An, FP; Li, XW; Ma, XM"				"An, Fengping; Li, Xiaowei; Ma, Xingmin"			Medical Image Classification Algorithm Based on Visual Attention Mechanism-MCNN	OXIDATIVE MEDICINE AND CELLULAR LONGEVITY			English	Article								"Due to the complexity of medical images, traditional medical image classification methods have been unable to meet the actual application needs. In recent years, the rapid development of deep learning theory has provided a technical approach for solving medical image classification. However, deep learning has the following problems in the application of medical image classification. First, it is impossible to construct a deep learning model with excellent performance according to the characteristics of medical images. Second, the current deep learning network structure and training strategies are less adaptable to medical images. Therefore, this paper first introduces the visual attention mechanism into the deep learning model so that the information can be extracted more effectively according to the problem of medical images, and the reasoning is realized at a finer granularity. It can increase the interpretability of the model. Additionally, to solve the problem of matching the deep learning network structure and training strategy to medical images, this paper will construct a novel multiscale convolutional neural network model that can automatically extract high-level discriminative appearance features from the original image, and the loss function uses the Mahalanobis distance optimization model to obtain a better training strategy, which can improve the robust performance of the network model. The medical image classification task is completed by the above method. Based on the above ideas, this paper proposes a medical classification algorithm based on a visual attention mechanism-multiscale convolutional neural network. The lung nodules and breast cancer images were classified by the method in this paper. The experimental results show that the accuracy of medical image classification in this paper is not only higher than that of traditional machine learning methods but also improved compared with other deep learning methods, and the method has good stability and robustness."

Despite the advancements in Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CADx) systems powered by deep learning, the challenge of accurately classifying brain tumors from MRI scans persists due to the high variability of tumor appearances and the subtlety of early-stage manifestations. This work introduces a novel adaptation of the EfficientNetv2 architecture, enhanced with Global Attention Mechanism (GAM) and Efficient Channel Attention (ECA), aimed at overcoming these hurdles. This enhancement not only amplifies the model's ability to focus on salient features within complex MRI images but also significantly improves the classification accuracy of brain tumors. Our approach distinguishes itself by meticulously integrating attention mechanisms that systematically enhance feature extraction, thereby achieving superior performance in detecting a broad spectrum of brain tumors. Demonstrated through extensive experiments on a large public dataset, our model achieves an exceptional high-test accuracy of 99.76%, setting a new benchmark in MRI-based brain tumor classification. Moreover, the incorporation of Grad-CAM visualization techniques sheds light on the model's decision-making process, offering transparent and interpretable insights that are invaluable for clinical assessment. By addressing the limitations inherent in previous models, this study not only advances the field of medical imaging analysis but also highlights the pivotal role of attention mechanisms in enhancing the interpretability and accuracy of deep learning models for brain tumor diagnosis. This research sets the stage for advanced CADx systems, enhancing patient care and treatment outcomes."

HMs are, however, reversible modifications: understanding their role in disease would allow the design of 'epigenetic drugs' for specific, non-invasive treatments. Standard statistical techniques were not entirely successful in extracting representative features from raw HM signals over gene locations. On the other hand, deep learning approaches allow for effective automatic feature extraction, but at the expense of model interpretation. Results Here, we propose ShallowChrome, a novel computational pipeline to model transcriptional regulation via HMs in both an accurate and interpretable way. We attain state-of-the-art results on the binary classification of gene transcriptional states over 56 cell-types from the REMC database, largely outperforming recent deep learning approaches. We interpret our models by extracting insightful gene-specific regulative patterns, and we analyse them for the specific case of the PAX5 gene over three differentiated blood cell lines. Finally, we compare the patterns we obtained with the characteristic emission patterns of ChromHMM, and show that ShallowChrome is able to coherently rank groups of chromatin states w.r.t. their transcriptional activity. Conclusions In this work we demonstrate that it is possible to model HM-modulated gene expression regulation in a highly accurate, yet interpretable way. Our feature extraction algorithm leverages on data downstream the identification of enriched regions to retrieve gene-wise, statistically significant and dynamically located features for each HM. These features are highly predictive of gene transcriptional state, and allow for accurate modeling by computationally efficient logistic regression models. These models allow a direct inspection and a rigorous interpretation, helping to formulate quantifiable hypotheses."

This study explores the improvement in the performance and interpretation of epigenetic clocks using deep learning. First, we gathered 142 publicly available data sets from several human tissues to develop AltumAge, a neural network framework that is a highly accurate and precise age predictor. Compared to ElasticNet, AltumAge performs better for within-data set and cross-data set age prediction, being particularly more generalizable in older ages and new tissue types. We then used deep learning interpretation methods to learn which methylation sites contributed to the final model predictions. We observe that while most important CpG sites are linearly related to age, some highly-interacting CpG sites can influence the relevance of such relationships. Using chromatin annotations, we show that the CpG sites with the highest contribution to the model predictions were related to gene regulatory regions in the genome, including proximity to CTCF binding sites. We also found age-related KEGG pathways for genes containing these CpG sites. Lastly, we performed downstream analyses of AltumAge to explore its applicability and compare its age acceleration with Horvath's 2013 model. We show that our neural network approach predicts higher age acceleration for tumors, for cells that exhibit age-related changes in vitro, such as immune and mitochondrial dysfunction, and for samples from patients with multiple sclerosis, type 2 diabetes, and HIV, among other conditions. Altogether, our neural network approach provides significant improvement and flexibility compared to current epigenetic clocks for both performance and model interpretability."

In this narrative review, we discuss strengths and limitations of UOG exposure assessment approaches used in or available for epidemiologic studies, emphasizing studies of children's health outcomes. Recent Findings Exposure assessment challenges include (1) numerous potential stressors with distinct spatiotemporal patterns, (2) critical exposure windows that cover long periods and occur in the past, and (3) limited existing monitoring data coupled with the resource-intensiveness of collecting new exposure measurements to capture spatiotemporal variation. All epidemiologic studies used proximity-based models for exposure assessment as opposed to surveys, biomonitoring, or environmental measurements. Nearly all studies used aggregate (rather than pathway-specific) models, which are useful surrogates for the complex mix of potential hazards. Summary Simple and less-specific exposure assessment approaches have benefits in terms of scalability, interpretability, and relevance to specific policy initiatives such as set-back distances. More detailed and specific models and metrics, including dispersion methods and stressor-specific models, could reduce exposure misclassification, illuminate underlying exposure pathways, and inform emission control and exposure mitigation strategies. While less practical in a large population, collection of multi-media environmental and biological exposure measurements would be feasible in cohort subsets. Such assessments are well-suited to provide insights into the presence and magnitude of exposures to UOG-related stressors in relation to spatial surrogates and to better elucidate the plausibility of observed effects in both children and adults."

However, US images commonly suffer from speckle noise, which degrades perceived image quality. Various deep learning approaches have been proposed for US image denoising, but most of them lack the interpretability of how the network is processing the US image (black box problem). In this work, we utilize a deep reinforcement learning (RL) approach, the pixelRL, to US image denoising. The technique utilizes a set of easily interpretable and commonly used filtering operations applied in a pixel-wise manner. In RL, software agents act in an unknown environment and receive appropriate numerical rewards. In our case, each pixel of the input US image has an agent and state of the environment is the current US image. Agents iteratively denoise the US image by executing the following pixel-wise pre-defined actions: Gaussian, bilateral, median and box filtering, pixel value increment/decrement and no action. The proposed approach can be used to generate action maps depicting operations applied to process different parts of the US image. Agents were pre-trained on natural gray-scale images and evaluated on the breast mass US images. To enable the evaluation, we artificially corrupted the US images with noise. Compared with the reference (noise free US images), filtration of the images with the proposed method increased the average peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) score from 14 dB to 26 dB and increased the structure similarity index score from 0.22 to 0.54. Our work confirms that it is feasible to use pixel-wise RL techniques for the US image denoising."

While the presentation, the pathology, and the clinical course of these lesions are variable, the initial investigations are usually similar. Patients who are suspected to have a brain tumor will be assessed with computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The imaging findings are used by neurosurgeons to determine the feasibility of surgical resection and plan such an undertaking. Imaging studies are also an indispensable tool in tracking tumor progression or its response to treatment. As these imaging studies are non-invasive, relatively cheap and accessible to patients, there have been many efforts over the past two decades to increase the amount of clinically-relevant information that can be extracted from brain imaging. Most recently, artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have been employed to segment and characterize brain tumors, as well as to detect progression or treatment-response. However, the clinical utility of such endeavours remains limited due to challenges in data collection and annotation, model training, and the reliability of AI-generated information. We provide a review of recent advances in addressing the above challenges. First, to overcome the challenge of data paucity, different image imputation and synthesis techniques along with annotation collection efforts are summarized. Next, various training strategies are presented to meet multiple desiderata, such as model performance, generalization ability, data privacy protection, and learning with sparse annotations. Finally, standardized performance evaluation and model interpretability methods have been reviewed. We believe that these technical approaches will facilitate the development of a fully-functional AI tool in the clinical care of patients with gliomas."

A review of mechanistic learning in mathematical oncology	FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY			English	Review						mathematical modeling; machine learning; deep learning; ODE (ordinary differential equation); mechanistic learning	INFORMED NEURAL-NETWORKS; MODELS; CANCER; GLIOBLASTOMA; SURVIVAL	"Mechanistic learning refers to the synergistic combination of mechanistic mathematical modeling and data-driven machine or deep learning. This emerging field finds increasing applications in (mathematical) oncology. This review aims to capture the current state of the field and provides a perspective on how mechanistic learning may progress in the oncology domain. We highlight the synergistic potential of mechanistic learning and point out similarities and differences between purely data-driven and mechanistic approaches concerning model complexity, data requirements, outputs generated, and interpretability of the algorithms and their results. Four categories of mechanistic learning (sequential, parallel, extrinsic, intrinsic) of mechanistic learning are presented with specific examples. We discuss a range of techniques including physics-informed neural networks, surrogate model learning, and digital twins. Example applications address complex problems predominantly from the domain of oncology research such as longitudinal tumor response predictions or time-to-event modeling. As the field of mechanistic learning advances, we aim for this review and proposed categorization framework to foster additional collaboration between the data- and knowledge-driven modeling fields. Further collaboration will help address difficult issues in oncology such as limited data availability, requirements of model transparency, and complex input data which are embraced in a mechanistic learning framework Data and knowledge both drive the progress of research and are the cornerstones of modeling. Depending on the emphasis, both data-driven (exemplified by machine and deep learning) and knowledge-driven (exemplified by mechanistic mathematical modeling) models generate novel results and insights. Mechanistic learning describes approaches that employ both data and knowledge in a complimentary and balanced way."

Using reference expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) studies, several methods have been proposed to identify gene-trait associations, primarily based on gene expression imputation. To increase the statistical power by leveraging substantial eQTL sharing across tissues, meta-analysis methods aggregating such gene-based test results across multiple tissues or contexts have been developed as well. However, most existing meta-analysis methods have limited power to identify associations when the gene has weaker associations in only a few tissues and cannot identify the subset of tissues in which the gene is activated. For this, we developed a cross-tissue subset-based transcriptome-wide association study (CSTWAS) meta-analysis method that improves power under such scenarios and can extract the set of potentially associated tissues. To improve applicability, CSTWAS uses only GWAS summary statistics and pre-computed correlation matrices to identify a subset of tissues that have the maximal evidence of gene-trait association. Through numerical simulations, we found that CSTWAS can maintain a well-calibrated type-I error rate, improves power especially when there is a small number of associated tissues for a gene-trait association, and identifies an accurate associated tissue set. By analyzing GWAS summary statistics of three complex traits and diseases, we demonstrate that CSTWAS could identify biological meaningful signals while providing an interpretation of disease etiology by extracting a set of potentially associated tissues."

Currently, treatment options include the drugs Olaparib, Niraparib, Rucaparib, and Talazoparib; however, these drugs can cause severe side effects including hematological toxicity and cardiotoxicity. Although in silico models for the prediction of PARP-1 activity have been developed, the drawbacks of these models include low specificity, a narrow applicability domain, and a lack of interpretability. To address these issues, a comprehensive machine learning (ML)-based quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) approach for the informed prediction of PARP-1 activity is presented. Classification models built using the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) for data balancing gave robust and predictive models based on the K-nearest neighbor algorithm (accuracy 0.86, sensitivity 0.88, specificity 0.80). Regression models were built on structurally congeneric datasets, with the models for the phthalazinone class and fused cyclic compounds giving the best performance. In accordance with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) guidelines, a mechanistic interpretation is proposed using the Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) to identify the important topological features to differentiate between PARP-1 actives and inactives. Moreover, an analysis of the PARP-1 dataset revealed the prevalence of activity cliffs, which possibly negatively impacts the model's predictive performance. Finally, a set of chemical transformation rules were extracted using the matched molecular pair analysis (MMPA) which provided mechanistic insights and can guide medicinal chemists in the design of novel PARP-1 inhibitors."

Articles with information regarding the development process, metric properties, and administration issues of pediatric instruments measuring oral health-related quality of life were eligible for inclusion. Two researchers independently evaluated each instrument applying the Evaluating Measures of Patient-Reported Outcomes (EMPRO) tool. An overall and seven attribute-specific EMPRO scores were calculated (range 0-100, worst to best): measurement model, reliability, validity, responsiveness, interpretability, burden, and alternative forms.ResultsWe identified 18 instruments evaluated in 132 articles. From five instruments designed for preschoolers, the Early Childhood Oral Health Impact Scale (ECOHIS) obtained the highest overall EMPRO score (82.2). Of nine identified for schoolchildren and adolescents, the best rated instrument was the Child Perceptions Questionnaire 11-14 (82.1). Among the four instruments developed for any age, the Family Impact Scale (FIS) obtained the highest scores (80.3).ConclusionThe evidence supports the use of the ECOHIS for preschoolers, while the age is a key factor when choosing among the four recommended instruments for schoolchildren and adolescents. Instruments for specific conditions, symptoms, or treatments need further research on metric properties.Clinical relevanceOur results facilitate decision-making on the correct oral health-related quality of life instrument selection for any certain study purpose and population during the childhood and adolescence life cycle."

Improving the Impact of BODY-Q Scores Through Minimal Important Differences in Body Contouring Surgery: An International Prospective Cohort Study	AESTHETIC SURGERY JOURNAL			English	Article; Early Access							QUALITY-OF-LIFE; PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES; MASSIVE WEIGHT-LOSS; BREAST-CANCER; ABDOMINOPLASTY; SATISFACTION	"Background The BODY-Q is a widely used patient-reported outcome measure for comprehensive assessment of treatment outcomes specific to patients undergoing body contouring surgery (BCS). However, for the BODY-Q to be meaningfully interpreted and used in clinical practice, minimal important difference (MID) scores are needed. A MID is defined as the smallest change in outcome measure score that patients perceive as important.Objectives The aim of this study was to determine BODY-Q MID estimates for patients undergoing BCS to enhance the interpretability of the BODY-Q.Methods Data from an international, prospective cohort from Denmark, Finland, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, and Poland were included. Two distribution-based methods were used to estimate MID: 0.2 standard deviations of mean baseline scores and the mean standardized response change of BODY-Q scores from baseline to 3 years postoperatively.Results A total of 12,554 assessments from 3237 participants (mean age 42.5 +/- 9.3 years; BMI 28.9 +/- 4.9 kg/m2) were included. Baseline MID scores ranged from 1 to 5 on the health-related quality of life (HRQL) scales and 3 to 6 on the appearance scales. The estimated MID scores from baseline to 3-year follow-up ranged from 4 to 5 for HRQL and from 4 to 8 on the appearance scales.Conclusions The BODY-Q MID estimates from before BCS to 3 years postoperatively ranged from 4 to 8 and are recommended for interpretation of patients' BODY-Q scores, evaluation of treatment effects of different BCS procedures, and calculation of sample size for future studies."

Viruses invade host cells and associate with host molecules, potentially disrupting the normal function of hosts that leads to fatal diseases. Novel viral genome prediction is crucial for understanding the complex viral diseases like AIDS and Ebola. While most existing computational techniques classify viral genomes, the efficiency of the classification depends solely on the structural features extracted. The state-of-the-art DNN models achieved excellent performance by automatic extraction of classification features, but the degree of model explainability is relatively poor. During model training for viral prediction, proposed CNN, CNN-LSTM based methods (EdeepVPP, EdeepVPP-hybrid) automatically extracts features. EdeepVPP also performs model interpretability in order to extract the most important patterns that cause viral genomes through learned filters. It is an interpretable CNN model that extracts vital biologically relevant patterns (features) from feature maps of viral sequences. The EdeepVPP-hybrid predictor outperforms all the existing methods by achieving 0.992 mean AUC-ROC and 0.990 AUC-PR on 19 human metagenomic contig experiment datasets using 10-fold cross-validation. We evaluate the ability of CNN filters to detect patterns across high average activation values. To further asses the robustness of EdeepVPP model, we perform leave-one-experiment-out cross-validation. It can work as a recommendation system to further analyze the raw sequences labeled as 'unknown' by alignment-based methods. We show that our interpretable model can extract patterns that are considered to be the most important features for predicting virus sequences through learned filters."

However, expectancy effects and effective condition masking have been raised as critical limitations to the interpretability of the research. Objective In this article, we review the many methodological challenges of conducting psychedelic clinical trials and provide recommendations for improving the rigor of future research. Results Although some challenges are shared with psychotherapy and pharmacology trials more broadly, psychedelic clinical trials have to contend with several unique sources of potential bias. The subjective effects of a high-dose psychedelic are often so pronounced that it is difficult to mask participants to their treatment condition; the significant hype from positive media coverage on the clinical potential of psychedelics influences participants' expectations for treatment benefit; and participant unmasking and treatment expectations can interact in such a way that makes psychedelic therapy highly susceptible to large placebo and nocebo effects. Specific recommendations to increase the success of masking procedures and reduce the influence of participant expectancies are discussed in the context of study development, participant recruitment and selection, incomplete disclosure of the study design, choice of active placebo condition, as well as the measurement of participant expectations and masking efficacy. Conclusion Incorporating the recommended design elements is intended to reduce the risk of bias in psychedelic clinical trials and thereby increases the ability to discern treatment-specific effects of psychedelic therapy."

Finding a subset of discriminatory genes (features) through intelligent algorithms has been trend. Based on this, building a disease prognosis expert system will bring a great effect on clinical medicine. In addition, the fewer the selected genes are, the less cost the disease prognosis expert system is. So the small gene set with high classification accuracy is what we need. In this paper, a multi-objective model is built according to the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), which treats the classification accuracy absolutely important than the number of selected genes. And a multi-objective heuristic algorithm called MOEDA is proposed to solve the model, which is an improvement of Univariate Marginal Distribution Algorithm. Two main rules are designed, one is 'Higher and Fewer Rule' which is used for evaluating and sorting individuals and the other is 'Forcibly Decrease Rule' which is used for generate potential individuals with high classification accuracy and fewer genes. Our proposed method is tested on both binary-class and multi-class microarray datasets. The results show that the gene set selected by MOEDA not only results in higher accuracies, but also keep a small scale, which cannot only save computational time but also improve the interpretability and application of the result with the simple classification model. The proposed MOEDA opens up a new way for the heuristic algorithms applying on microarray gene expression data. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

This perspective summarizes the current applications, discusses future potential and challenges, and provides recommendations for harnessing ML and AI technologies to develop innovative public health solutions. ML and AI have been increasingly applied in epidemiological studies, demonstrating their ability to handle large, complex datasets, identify intricate patterns and associations, integrate multiple and multimodal data types, improve predictive accuracy, and enhance causal inference methods. In life-course epidemiology, these techniques can help identify sensitive periods and critical windows for intervention, model complex interactions between risk factors, predict individual and population-level disease risk trajectories, and strengthen causal inference in observational studies. By leveraging the five principles of life-course research proposed by Elder and Shanahan-lifespan development, agency, time and place, timing, and linked lives-we discuss a framework for applying ML and AI to uncover novel insights and inform targeted interventions. However, the successful integration of these technologies faces challenges related to data quality, model interpretability, bias, privacy, and equity. To fully realize the potential of ML and AI in life-course epidemiology, fostering interdisciplinary collaborations, developing standardized guidelines, advocating for their integration in public health decision-making, prioritizing fairness, and investing in training and capacity building are essential. By responsibly harnessing the power of ML and AI, we can take significant steps towards creating healthier and more equitable futures across the life course."

A single ultrasound scan provides 3D spinal views directly. However, measuring ultrasonograph parameters is challenging, time-consuming, and requires considerable training. This study aimed to validate a machine learning method to measure the coronal curve angle on ultrasonographs automatically.MethodsA total of 144 3D spinal ultrasonographs were extracted to train and validate a machine learning model. Among the 144 images, 70 were used for training, and 74 consisted of 144 curves for testing. Automatic coronal curve angle measurements were validated by comparing them with manual measurements performed by an experienced rater. The inter-method intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC2,1), standard error of measurement (SEM), and percentage of measurements within clinical acceptance (<= 5 degrees) were analyzed.ResultsThe automatic method detected 125/144 manually measured curves. The averages of the 125 manual and automatic coronal curve angle measurements were 22.4 +/- 8.0 degrees and 22.9 +/- 8.7 degrees, respectively. Good reliability was achieved with ICC2,1 = 0.81 and SEM = 1.4 degrees. A total of 75% (94/125) of the measurements were within clinical acceptance. The average measurement time per ultrasonograph was 36 +/- 7 s. Additionally, the algorithm displayed the predicted centers of laminae to illustrate the measurement.ConclusionThe automatic algorithm measured the coronal curve angle with moderate accuracy but good reliability. The algorithm's quick measurement time and interpretability can make ultrasound a more accessible imaging method for children with AIS. However, further improvements are needed to bring the method to clinical use."

However, medical images are often faced with distribution shifts due to different grades of cancers, various imaging qualities, and data from different medical institutions. Model calibration is highly related to domain generalization ability, and well-calibrated deep models show good domain generalization ability. Besides, ensemble learning is an implicit method for model calibration where domain shift problems can be alleviated by combining multiple models. In this paper, we aim to improve the generalization ability by explicitly calibrating the model in an ensemble. We proposed Mixture of Calibrated Networks (MCN) where multiple networks are jointly learned on the source and the augmented domain. We introduce a temperature scale to each network in an ensemble, which can be seen as the uncertainty of each domain to calibrate the predicted probabilities. These temperature scales form an uncertainty-aware loss to adaptively weigh the losses of multiple networks. The expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is used to learn the parameters and explicitly model the relationship between key parameters, achieving better interpretability and robust parameter estimation. Moreover, we introduce an orthogonal constraint between convolutional kernels from the corresponding layer of multiple sub-networks, which keeps the diversity of sub-networks. We conduct extensive experiments on the brain tumor segmentation dataset from BRATS 2018, BRATS 2019, BRATS 2020, and FeTS 2021. Our proposed approach consistently improves the generalization performance and shows better calibration over inter-domain methods and intra-domain methods. (c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

The objective of this study was to assist radiologists in mammography phantom image evaluation by developing and validating an interpretable deep learning model capable of objectively evaluating the quality of standard phantom images for mammography.Materials and Methods: A total of 2,208 mammography phantom images were collected for periodic accreditation of the scanner from 1,755 institutions. The dataset was randomly split into training (1,808 images) and testing (400 images) datasets with subgroups (76 images) for the multi-reader study. To develop an interpretable model that contains two deep learning networks in series, five processing steps were performed: mammography phantom detection, phantom object detection, post-processing, score evaluation, and a report with a comment about ambiguous results. Results: For phantom detection, the accuracy and mean intersection over union (mIOU) were 1.00 and 0.938 in the test dataset, respectively. During phantom object detection, a total of 6,369 out of 6,400 objects were detected as the correct object class, and the accuracy and mIOU were 0.995 and 0.813, respectively. The predicted score for each object showed a consensus of 97.40% excluding ambiguous points and 59.10% for ambiguous points of the groups.Conclusions: The interpretable deep learning model using large-scale data from multiple centers shows high performance and reasonable object scoring, successfully validating the reliability and feasibility of mammography phantom image quality management."

Methods A systematic review was performed in MEDLINE and EMBASE databases. Titles and abstracts were reviewed and finally the included articles were grouped according to patients' pathologies. Two expert evaluators independently assessed the CMS properties of reliability, validity, responsiveness to change, interpretability and burden score in each group, using the EMPRO (Evaluating Measures of Patient Reported Outcomes) tool. The CMS properties were assessed per attribute and overall for each considered group. Only the concept and measurement model was assessed globally. Results Five individual pathologies (i.e. subacromial, fractures, arthritis, instability and frozen shoulder) and two additional groups (i.e. various pathologies and healthy subjects) were considered. Overall EMPRO scores ranged from 58.6 for subacromial to 30.6 points for instability. Responsiveness to change was the only quality to obtain at least 50 points across all groups, but for frozen shoulder. Insufficient information was obtained in relation to the concept and measurement model and great variability was seen in the other evaluated attributes. Conclusions The current evidence does not support the CMS as a gold standard in shoulder evaluation. Its use is advisable for subacromial pathology; but data are inconclusive for other shoulder conditions. Prospective studies exploring the psychometric properties of the scale, particularly for fractures, arthritis, instability and frozen shoulder are needed."

However, methodological limitations (e.g., placebo-control, blinding) limit interpretability of the existing literature. Methods: In an exploratory placebo-controlled, within-subject, fixed-order study, individuals with moderate to severe major depressive disorder were administered placebo (n = 19) followed by psilocybin (0.3 mg/kg) (n = 15) 4 weeks later. Dosing sessions were embedded within an manualized course of psychotherapy. Enhanced blinding procedures were used. Depression, anxiety, and quality of life were measured over a 16-week study period. Results: Depression and anxiety significantly improved following both placebo and psilocybin with no significant difference in the degree of change between the two conditions. However, antidepressant effect sizes were larger after psilocybin (d ' = 1.02-2.27) than after placebo (d ' = 0.65-0.99) and there were high rates of response (66.7%) and remission (46.7%) following psilocybin administration. Antidepressant effects following psilocybin persisted, on average, for 2 months and there were persisting improvements in mood-related quality of life domains. The strength of mystical-type experience during psilocybin dosing was not correlated with subsequent antidepressant effects. Conclusions: The results of this exploratory study highlight the complex interplay between expectancy, therapy effects, and drug/placebo effects in psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy studies. Nonetheless, the acute and persisting clinical improvements observed following psilocybin support further study of its potential in the treatment of major depression. Future studies should more explicitly mitigate and measure expectancy effects and assess the impact of repeated dosing and different forms of psychotherapeutic support."

In fact, it allows identifying the most important attributes of the task at hand, improving the efficiency, interpretability, and final performance of the induced models. In recent literature, several studies have examined the strengths and weaknesses of the available feature selection methods from different points of view. Still, little work has been performed to investigate how sensitive they are to the presence of noisy instances in the input data. This is the specific field in which our work wants to make a contribution. Indeed, since noise is arguably inevitable in several application scenarios, it would be important to understand the extent to which the different selection heuristics can be affected by noise, in particular class noise (which is more harmful in supervised learning tasks). Such an evaluation may be especially important in the context of class-imbalanced problems, where any perturbation in the set of training records can strongly affect the final selection outcome. In this regard, we provide here a two-fold contribution by presenting (i) a general methodology to evaluate feature selection robustness on class noisy data and (ii) an experimental study that involves different selection methods, both univariate and multivariate. The experiments have been conducted on eight high-dimensional datasets chosen to be representative of different real-world domains, with interesting insights into the intrinsic degree of robustness of the considered selection approaches."

However, current screening protocols are often not effective at finding the disease early. Volumetric Laser Endomicroscopy (VLE) is a promising new imaging tool for finding dysplasia in Barrett's esophagus (BE) at an early stage, by acquiring cross-sectional images of the microscopic structure of BE up to 3-mm deep. However, interpretation of VLE scans is difficult for medical doctors due to both the size and subtlety of the gray-scale data. Therefore, algorithms that can accurately find cancerous regions are very valuable for the interpretation of VLE data. In this study, we propose a fully-automatic multi-step Computer-Aided Detection (CAD) algorithm that optimally leverages the effectiveness of deep learning strategies by encoding the principal dimension in VLE data. Additionally, we show that combining the encoded dimensions with conventional machine learning techniques further improves results while maintaining interpretability. Furthermore, we train and validate our algorithm on a new histopathologically validated set of in-vivo VLE snapshots. Additionally, an independent test set is used to assess the performance of the model. Finally, we compare the performance of our algorithm against previous state-of-the-art systems. With the encoded principal dimension, we obtain an Area Under the Curve (AUC) and F-1 score of 0.93 and 87.4% on the test set respectively. We show this is a significant improvement compared to the state-of-the-art of 0.89 and 83.1%, respectively, thereby demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

Many previous sparse methods have been proposed that using prior knowledge, e.g., biological group structure information, to guide the model-building process. However, these methods are still based on a single model, offen leading to overconfident inferences and inferior generalization.Results We proposed a novel stacking strategy based on a non-negative spike-and-slab Lasso (nsslasso) generalized linear model (GLM) for disease risk prediction in the context of high-dimensional omics data. Briefly, we used prior biological knowledge to segment omics data into a set of sub-data. Each sub-model was trained separately using the features from the group via a proper base learner. Then, the predictions of sub-models were ensembled by a super learner using nsslasso GLM. The proposed method was compared to several competitors, such as the Lasso, grlasso, and gsslasso, using simulated data and two open-access breast cancer data. As a result, the proposed method showed robustly superior prediction performance to the optimal single-model method in high-noise simulated data and real-world data. Furthermore, compared to the traditional stacking method, the proposed nsslasso stacking method can efficiently handle redundant sub-models and identify important sub-models.Conclusions The proposed nsslasso method demonstrated favorable predictive accuracy, stability, and biological interpretability. Additionally, the proposed method can also be used to detect new biomarkers and key group structures."

In previous years, an in vitro approach was utilized to screen synergistic drug combinations. However, the in vitro method is time-consuming and expensive. With the rapid growth of high -throughput data, computational methods are becoming efficient tools to predict potential synergistic drug combinations. Considering the limitations of the previous computational methods, we developed a new model named Siamese Network and Random Matrix Projection for AntiCancer Drug Combination prediction (SNRMPACDC). Firstly, the Siamese convolutional network and random matrix projection were used to process the features of the two drugs into drug combination features. Then, the features of the cancer cell line were processed through the convolutional network. Finally, the processed features were integrated and input into the multi -layer perceptron network to get the predicted score. Compared with the traditional method of splicing drug features into drug combination features, SNRMPACDC improved the interpretability of drug combination features to a certain extent. In addition, the introduction of convolutional networks can better extract the potential information in the features. SNRMPACDC achieved the root mean -squared error of 15.01 and the Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.75 in 5 -fold cross -validation of regression prediction for response data. In addition, SNRMPACDC achieved the AUC of 0.91 +/- 0.03 and the AUPR of 0.62 +/- 0.05 in 5 -fold cross -validation of classification prediction of synergistic or not. These results are almost better than all the previous models. SNRMPACDC would be an effective approach to infer potential anticancer synergistic drug combinations."

A deep neural network takes the activation function as the basic unit. It is inferior to the spiking neural network, which takes the spiking neuron model as the basic unit in the aspect of biological interpretability. The spiking neural network is considered as the third-generation artificial neural network, which is event-driven and has low power consumption. It modulates the process of nerve cells from receiving a stimulus to firing spikes. However, it is difficult to train spiking neural network directly due to the non-differentiable spiking neurons. In particular, it is impossible to train a spiking neural network using the back-propagation algorithm directly. Therefore, the application scenarios of spiking neural network are not as extensive as deep neural network, and a spiking neural network is mostly used in simple image classification tasks. This paper proposed a spiking neural network method for the field of object detection based on medical images using the method of converting a deep neural network to spiking neural network. The detection framework relies on the YOLO structure and uses the feature pyramid structure to obtain the multi-scale features of the image. By fusing the high resolution of low-level features and the strong semantic information of high-level features, the detection precision of the network is improved. The proposed method is applied to detect the location and classification of breast lesions with ultrasound and X-ray datasets, and the results are 90.67% and 92.81%, respectively."

Due to its voluminous and heterogeneous nature, the question arises of the interpretability and stability of the traditional gene selection method. To enhance the stability of the gene selection method, so that the results are better explicable, an ameliorated Extended ReliefF gene selection algorithm is proposed. It encodes gene affinity information using a new mathematical formula based on Bayes' theorem and Manhattan distance for calculating the nearest neighbor in a pooled sample. It works in four aspects: initializing sample gene weight, improving gene weight, maximizing sample gene weight and finally adopting mutation operation. The proposed method selects the most informative genes which are highly perceptive to the prognosis of the disease. Further, to accomplish the accuracy and stability of the algorithm, soft classification is performed on Relieved_F, STIR, VLS-RelifF, I-RelieF, conventional ReliefF and proposed extended ReliefF algorithms using three classifiers namely Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Random Forest (RF) on ten microarray datasets. According to the findings, MLP training times are much longer than those of RF and SVM. From a network perspective, SVM is much faster at training, whereas MLP excels in terms of accuracy. With a rise in gene similarity among the genes selected from the multiple training sets, the approach becomes more stable. As a result, it can be seen that the recommended gene selection algorithm greatly outperforms the other feature selection methods in terms of accuracy and stability."

One of the main concerns is the ability to trust these architectures' without being provided any insight into the decision-making process. Despite these concerns, researchers continue to explore new models and architectures that do not incorporate explainability into their main construct. In the medical industry, it is crucial to provide explanations of any decision, as patient health outcomes can vary according to decisions made. Furthermore, in medical research, incorrectly diagnosed neurological conditions are a high-cost error that contributes significantly to morbidity and mortality. Therefore, the development of new transparent techniques for neurological conditions is critical. This paper presents a novel Autonomous Relevance Technique for an Explainable neurological disease prediction framework called ART-Explain. The proposed technique autonomously extracts features from within the deep learning architecture to create novel visual explanations of the resulting prediction. ART-Explain is an end-to-end autonomous explainable technique designed to present an intuitive and holistic overview of a prediction made by a deep learning classifier. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we benchmark it with other state-of-the-art techniques using three data sets of neurological disorders. The results demonstrate the generalisation capabilities of our technique and its suitability for real-world applications. By providing transparent insights into the decision-making process, ART-Explain can improve end-user trust and enable a better understanding of classification outcomes in the detection of neurological diseases."

Our purpose was to develop CNN models to classify SSNs on CT images and to investigate image features associated with the CNN classification. Methods CT images containing SSNs with a diameter of <= 3 cm were retrospectively collected. We trained and validated CNNs by a 5-fold cross-validation method for classifying SSNs into three categories (benign and preinvasive lesions [PL], minimally invasive adenocarcinoma [MIA], and invasive adenocarcinoma [IA]) that were histologically confirmed or followed up for 6.4 years. The mechanism of CNNs on human-recognizable CT image features was investigated and visualized by gradient-weighted class activation map (Grad-CAM), separated activation channels and areas, and DeepDream algorithm. Results The accuracy was 93% for classifying 586 SSNs from 569 patients into three categories (346 benign and PL, 144 MIA, and 96 IA in 5-fold cross-validation). The Grad-CAM successfully located the entire region of image features that determined the final classification. Activated areas in the benign and PL group were primarily smooth margins (p < 0.001) and ground-glass components (p = 0.033), whereas in the IA group, the activated areas were mainly part-solid (p < 0.001) and solid components (p < 0.001), lobulated shapes (p < 0.001), and air bronchograms (p < 0.001). However, the activated areas for MIA were variable. The DeepDream algorithm showed the image features in a human-recognizable pattern that the CNN learned from a training dataset. Conclusion This study provides medical evidence to interpret the mechanism of CNNs that helps support the clinical application of artificial intelligence."

Therefore, researchers were encouraged to explore and develop new machine learning ideas and methods. Mixture models are one of the machine learning techniques receiving considerable attention due to their ability to handle efficiently and effectively multidimensional data. In this paper, we represent a solution for two challenging issues: modeling non-Gaussian data and determining the set of relevant features in the data. The problem of modeling non-Gaussian data largely present in several computer vision, image processing, medical, and Bioinformatics applications is accomplished by the development of a generative infinite Gamma mixture model. The Gamma is chosen for its ability to handle long-tailed distributions, which allows it to have a good approximation to data with outliers. The proposed model, which can be viewed as a Dirichlet process mixture of Gamma distributions, takes into account the feature selection problem by determining a set of relevant features for each data cluster which provides better interpretability and generalization capabilities. We propose then an efficient algorithm to learn this infinite model's parameters by estimating all its posterior quantities of interest using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations. Thus, our algorithm is able to perform model selection, parameter learning, and feature selection simultaneously in a single step for the Gamma Mixture model. Furthermore, we show how the model can be used, while comparing it with other popular models in the literature, in two challenging applications namely medical images and gene expressions classification."

This is partly due to training and convention but also roots in scientists' strong interests in simple visualization and interpretability. As such, marginal feature ranking for some predictive tasks, e.g., prediction of cancer driver genes, is widely practiced in the process of scientific discoveries. In this work, we focus on marginal ranking for binary classification, one of the most common predictive tasks. We argue that the most widely used marginal ranking criteria, including the Pearson correlation, the two-sample t test, and two-sample Wilcoxon rank-sum test, do not fully take feature distributions and prediction objectives into account. To address this gap in practice, we propose two ranking criteria corresponding to two prediction objectives: the classical criterion (CC) and the Neyman-Pearson criterion (NPC), both of which use model-free nonparametric implementations to accommodate diverse feature distributions. Theoretically, we show that under regularity conditions, both criteria achieve sample-level ranking that is consistent with their population-level counterpart with high probability. Moreover, NPC is robust to sampling bias when the two class proportions in a sample deviate from those in the population. This property endows NPC good potential in biomedical research where sampling biases are ubiquitous. We demonstrate the use and relative advantages of CC and NPC in simulation and real data studies. Our model-free objective-based ranking idea is extendable to ranking feature subsets and generalizable to other prediction tasks and learning objectives."

With the first ratification of a computer vision algorithm as a medical device in 2018, the way was paved for these methods to eventually become an integral part of modern clinical practice. Objectives The purpose of this article is to review the main developments that have occurred over the last few years in AI for image analysis, in relation to clinical applications and dermatology. Materials and methods Following the annual ImageNet challenge, we review classical methods of machine learning for image analysis and demonstrate how these methods incorporated human expertise but failed to meet industrial requirements regarding performance and scalability. With the rise of deep learning based on artificial neural networks, these limitations could be overcome. We discuss important aspects of this technology including transfer learning and report on recent developments such as explainable AI and generative models. Results Deep learning models achieved performance on a par with human experts in a broad variety of diagnostic tasks and were shown to be suitable for industrialization. Therefore, current developments focus less on further improving accuracy but rather address open issues such as interpretability and applicability under clinical conditions. Upcoming generative models allow for entirely new applications. Conclusions Deep learning has a history of remarkable success and has become the new technical standard for image analysis. The dramatic improvement these models brought over classical approaches enables applications in a rapidly increasing number of clinical fields. In dermatology, as in many other domains, artificial intelligence still faces considerable challenges but is undoubtedly developing into an essential tool of modern medicine."

Here we propose a rule-based system to differentiate thyroid nodules from intraoperative frozen sections using deep learning techniques. The proposed system consists of three components: (1) automatically locating tissue regions in the whole slide images (WSIs), (2) splitting located tissue regions into patches and classifying each patch into predefined categories using convolutional neural networks (CNN), and (3) integrating predictions of all patches to form the final diagnosis with a rule-based system. To be specific, we fine-tune the InceptionV3 model for thyroid patch classification by replacing the last fully connected layer with three outputs representing the patch's probabilities of being benign, uncertain, or malignant. Moreover, we design a rule-based protocol to integrate patches' predictions to form the final diagnosis, which provides interpretability for the proposed system. On 259 testing slides, the system correctly predicts 95.3% (61/64) of benign nodules and 96.7% (148/153) of malignant nodules, and classify 16.2% (42/259) slides as uncertain, including 19 benign and 16 malignant slides, which are a sufficiently small number to be manually examined by pathologists or fully processed through permanent sections. Besides, the system allows the localization of suspicious regions along with the diagnosis. A typical whole slide image, with 80, 000 x 60, 000 pixels, can be diagnosed within 1 min, thus satisfying the time requirement for intraoperative diagnosis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to apply deep learning to diagnose thyroid nodules from intraoperative frozen sections.

Diagnostic accuracy of content-based dermatoscopic image retrieval with deep classification features	BRITISH JOURNAL OF DERMATOLOGY			English	Article							PERFORMANCE	"Background Automated classification of medical images through neural networks can reach high accuracy rates but lacks interpretability. Objectives To compare the diagnostic accuracy obtained by using content-based image retrieval (CBIR) to retrieve visually similar dermatoscopic images with corresponding disease labels against predictions made by a neural network. Methods A neural network was trained to predict disease classes on dermatoscopic images from three retrospectively collected image datasets containing 888, 2750 and 16 691 images, respectively. Diagnosis predictions were made based on the most commonly occurring diagnosis in visually similar images, or based on the top-1 class prediction of the softmax output from the network. Outcome measures were area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for predicting a malignant lesion, multiclass-accuracy and mean average precision (mAP), measured on unseen test images of the corresponding dataset. Results In all three datasets the skin cancer predictions from CBIR (evaluating the 16 most similar images) showed AUC values similar to softmax predictions (0.842, 0.806 and 0.852 vs. 0.830, 0.810 and 0.847, respectively; P > 0.99 for all). Similarly, the multiclass-accuracy of CBIR was comparable with softmax predictions. Compared with softmax predictions, networks trained for detecting only three classes performed better on a dataset with eight classes when using CBIR (mAP 0.184 vs. 0.368 and 0.198 vs. 0.403, respectively). Conclusions Presenting visually similar images based on features from a neural network shows comparable accuracy with the softmax probability-based diagnoses of convolutional neural networks. CBIR may be more helpful than a softmax classifier in improving diagnostic accuracy of clinicians in a routine clinical setting."

MethodsData for hospitalized patients in the AKI Recovery Evaluation Study were derived from a large healthcare delivery system in Taiwan between January 2011 and December 2017. Living patients with AKI non-recovery were used to derive and validate multiple predictive models. In total, 64 candidates variables, such as demographic characteristics, comorbidities, healthcare services utilization, laboratory values, and nephrotoxic medication use, were measured within 1 year before the index admission and during hospitalization for AKI. ResultsAmong the top 20 important features in the predictive model, 8 features had a positive effect on AKI non-recovery prediction: AKI during hospitalization, serum creatinine (SCr) level at admission, receipt of dialysis during hospitalization, baseline comorbidity of cancer, AKI at admission, baseline lymphocyte count, baseline potassium, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. The predicted AKI non-recovery risk model using the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve statistic of 0.807, discrimination with a sensitivity of 0.724, and a specificity of 0.738 in the temporal validation cohort. ConclusionThe machine learning model approach can accurately predict AKI non-recovery using routinely collected health data in clinical practice. These results suggest that multifactorial risk factors are involved in AKI non-recovery, requiring patient-centered risk assessments and promotion of post-discharge AKI care to prevent AKI complications."

A series of the studies reported the application of deep learning (DL)-assisted EUS in the diagnosis of pancreatic diseases. This systematic review is to evaluate the role of DL algorithms in assisting EUS diagnosis of pancreatic diseases.Methods: Literature search were conducted in PubMed and Semantic Scholar databases. Studies that developed DL models for pancreatic diseases based on EUS were eligible for inclusion. This review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines and quality assessment of the included studies was performed according to the IJMEDI checklist.Results: A total of 23 studies were enrolled into this systematic review, which could be categorized into three groups according to computer vision tasks: classification, detection and segmentation. Seventeen studies focused on the classification task, among which five studies developed simple neural network (NN) models while twelve studies constructed convolutional NN (CNN) models. Three studies were concerned the detection task and five studies were the segmentation task, all based on CNN architectures. All models presented in the studies per-formed well based on EUS images, videos or voice. According to the IJMEDI checklist, six studies were recog-nized as high-grade quality, with scores beyond 35 points.Conclusions: DL algorithms show great potential in EUS images/videos/voice for pancreatic diseases. However, there is room for improvement such as sample sizes, multi-center cooperation, data preprocessing, model interpretability, and code sharing."

Therefore, a variety of machine learning-based models have been developed to predict these interactions. In this study, a model called auxiliary multi-task graph isomorphism network with uncertainty weighting (AMGU) was developed to predict the inhibitory activities of small molecules against 204 different kinases based on the multi-task Graph Isomorphism Network (MT-GIN) with the auxiliary learning and uncertainty weighting strategy. The calculation results illustrate that the AMGU model outperformed the descriptor-based models and state-of-the-art graph neural networks (GNN) models on the internal test set. Furthermore, it also exhibited much better performance on two external test sets, suggesting that the AMGU model has enhanced generalizability due to its great transfer learning capacity. Then, a nai spacing diaeresis ve model-agnostic interpretable method for GNN called edges masking was devised to explain the underlying predictive mechanisms, and the consistency of the interpretability results for 5 typical epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors with their structure-activity relationships could be observed. Finally, a free online web server called KIP was developed to predict the kinome-wide polypharmacology effects of small molecules (http://cadd.zju.edu.cn/kip).(c) 2023 Chinese Pharmaceutical Association and Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences.

However, for describing the survival after an intervention that may occur at different times from baseline observation, the Kaplan-Meier estimator generally yields to biased results if intervention is considered as fixed at baseline. The main focus of the present paper is to extend the use of a multiple timescale model in the presence of a time dependent intervention. The aim is to obtain 1) an estimate of treatment effect in terms of hazard ratios by flexible modeling, 2) a valid prediction tool, i.e. estimate of prognosis for a patient who changes treatment later in time, and 3) an appropriate graphical representation of survival in the presence of a time dependent treatment change, accounting for different timescales. We will show the advantages of this approach on the comparison of chemotherapy versus transplant in children with high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia in first remission. We considered a model with two timescales that accounts for the change in treatment at different times in the disease course. An alternative approach to survival estimates is also proposed which has some advantages over the traditional landmark approach: it uses all the data available to plot survival from the date of remission, it avoids the arbitrary choice of a landmark time and explicitly models the change in hazard due to transplant.

Ideally, the data and associated AI systems could be described using terms already familiar to physicians, but this requires medical datasets densely annotated with semantically meaningful concepts. In the present study, we present a foundation model approach, named MONET (medical concept retriever), which learns how to connect medical images with text and densely scores images on concept presence to enable important tasks in medical AI development and deployment such as data auditing, model auditing and model interpretation. Dermatology provides a demanding use case for the versatility of MONET, due to the heterogeneity in diseases, skin tones and imaging modalities. We trained MONET based on 105,550 dermatological images paired with natural language descriptions from a large collection of medical literature. MONET can accurately annotate concepts across dermatology images as verified by board-certified dermatologists, competitively with supervised models built on previously concept-annotated dermatology datasets of clinical images. We demonstrate how MONET enables AI transparency across the entire AI system development pipeline, from building inherently interpretable models to dataset and model auditing, including a case study dissecting the results of an AI clinical trial. By learning to pair dermatological images and related concepts in a self-supervised manner, a visual-language foundation model is shown to have comparable performance to supervised models for concept annotation and is used to scrutinize model decisions for enhanced interpretability and accountability of medical imaging applications."

Latent profile analysis (LPA) can identify profiles of AYAs based on their HRQOL scores reflecting physical, mental, and social well-being. This paper will (1) demonstrate how to use LPA to identify profiles of AYAs based on their scores on multiple HRQOL indicators; (2) explore associations of demographic and clinical factors with LPA-identified HRQOL profiles of AYAs; and (3) provide guidance on the selection of adult or pediatric versions of Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (R) (PROMIS (R)) in AYAs. A total of 872 AYAs with chronic conditions completed the adult and pediatric versions of PROMIS measures of anger, anxiety, depression, fatigue, pain interference, social health, and physical function. The optimal number of LPA profiles was determined by model fit statistics and clinical interpretability. Multinomial regression models examined clinical and demographic factors associated with profile membership. As a result of the LPA, AYAs were categorized into 3 profiles: Minimal, Moderate, and Severe HRQOL Impact profiles. Comparing LPA results using either the pediatric or adult PROMIS T-scores found approximately 71% of patients were placed in the same HRQOL profiles. AYAs who were female, had hypertension, mental health conditions, chronic pain, and those on medication were more likely to be placed in the Severe HRQOL Impact Profile. Our findings may facilitate clinicians to screen AYAs who may have low HRQOL due to diseases or treatments with the identified risk factors without implementing the HRQOL assessment."

Spatially coherent modeling of 3D FDG-PET data for assessment of intratumoral heterogeneity and uptake gradients	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL IMAGING			English	Article						heterogeneity; uptake gradient; positron emission tomography; sarcoma; spatial statistics; tumor characterization	F-18-FDG PET; TEXTURE ANALYSIS	"Purpose: Radiomics have become invaluable for non-invasive cancer patient risk prediction, and the community now turns to exogenous assessment, e.g., from genomics, for interpretability of these agnostic analyses. Yet, some opportunities for clinically interpretable modeling of positron emission tomography (PET) imaging data remain unexplored, that could facilitate insightful characterization at voxel level. Approach: Here, we present a novel deformable tubular representation of the distribution of tracer uptake within a volume of interest, and derive interpretable prognostic summaries from it. This data-adaptive strategy yields a 3D-coherent and smooth model fit, and a profile curve describing tracer uptake as a function of voxel location within the volume. Local trends in uptake rates are assessed at each voxel via the calculation of gradients derived from this curve. Intratumoral heterogeneity can also be assessed directly from it. Results: We illustrate the added value of this approach over previous strategies, in terms of volume rendering and coherence of the structural representation of the data. We further demonstrate consistency of the implementation via simulations, and prognostic potential of heterogeneity and statistical summaries of the uptake gradients derived from the model on a clinical cohort of 158 sarcoma patients imaged with F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose-PET, in multivariate prognostic models of patient survival. Conclusions: The proposed approach captures uptake characteristics consistently at any location, and yields a description of variations in uptake that holds prognostic value complementarily to structural heterogeneity. This creates opportunities for monitoring of local areas of greater interest within a tumor, e.g., to assess therapeutic response in avid locations.

The present study aimed at translating and examining the psychometric properties of the Pain Management Self-Efficacy Questionnaire (PMSEQ) among Iranian nurses. Methods: This was a cross-sectional, methodological study conducted in 2019 among nurses working in two teaching hospitals in Sanandaj (Tohid and Kosar). The participants were selected using a convenience sampling method. Responsiveness; interpretability; and face, content, and construct validities were examined using exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses. In addition, internal consistency and stability were examined using the Cronbach's alpha and test-retest, respectively. Results: Overall, 410 nurses (210 for the EFA and 200 for the CFA) were included in the sample. In the exploratory factor analysis, two factors of comprehensive pain assessment and pain management with eigenvalues of 6.36 and 1.91, respectively, were extracted. The two factors together explained 56.64% of the variance of nurses' pain management self-efficacy. The confirmatory factor analysis indicated that the model had a moderate fit to the data (RMSEA: 0.12; NFI: 0.84; NNFI: 0.86; CFI: 0.88; IFI: 0.88; RFI: 0.81; GFI: 0.76; AGFI: 0.69; PGFI: 0.59; RMR: 0.09; standardized RMR: 0.09). Total questionnaire and the two factors (i.e. comprehensive pain assessment and pain management) had internal consistency coefficients of 0.891, 0.876, and 0.803, respectively. Conclusion: The Farsi version of PMSEQ had good internal consistency and reliability, as well as content and construct validity, and can be used in future studies."

Discovery and experimental validation of miRNA is a laborious and time-consuming process. For early prediction, multiple bioinformatics databases are available for miRNA target prediction; however, their utility can confuse amateur researchers in selecting the most appropriate tools for their study. Objective This descriptive review aimed to analyse the usability of the existing database based on the following criteria: accessibility, efficiency, interpretability, updatability, and flexibility for miRNA target prediction of 3'UTR of mRNA in diverse species so that the researchers can utilize the database most appropriate to their research. Methods A systematic literature search was performed in PubMed, Google Scholar and Scopus databases up to November 2022. >= 10,000 articles found online, including similar to 130 miRNA tools, which contain various information on miRNA. Out of them, 31 databases that provide information on validated 3'UTR miRNAs target databases were included and analysed in this review. Results These miRNA database tools are being used in varied areas of biological research to select the most suitable miRNA for their experimental validation. These databases, updated until the year 2021, consist of miRNA-related data from humans, animals, mice, plants, viruses etc. They contain 525-29806351 data entries, and information from most databases is freely available on the online platform. Conclusion Reviewed databases provide significant information, but not all information is accurate or up-to-date. Therefore, Diana-TarBase and miRWalk are the most comprehensive and up-to-date databases."

Fundamental to these approaches are the mathematical and computational models used to describe the different states at microscopic (for example a biochemical reaction), mesoscopic (the signalling effects at tissue level), and macroscopic levels (physiological and pathological effects) of biological processes. In this paper we address the problem of combining two powerful classes of methodologies: Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) methods which are now producing a revolution in biotechnology and medicine, and Petri Nets (PNs) which allow system generalisation and are central to various mathematical treatments, for example Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) specification of the biosystem under study. While the former is limited to modelling metabolic networks, i.e. does not account for intermittent dynamical signalling events, the latter is hampered by the need for a large amount of metabolic data. A first result presented in this paper is the identification of three types of cross-talks between PNs and FBA methods and their dependencies on available data. We exemplify our insights with the analysis of a pancreatic cancer model. We discuss how our reasoning framework provides a biologically and mathematically grounded decision making setting for the integration of regulatory, signalling, and metabolic networks and greatly increases model interpretability and reusability. We discuss how the parameters of PN and FBA models can be tuned and combined together so to highlight the computational effort needed to perform this task. We conclude with speculations and suggestions on this new promising research direction."

However, they are commonly treated as black boxes. Therefore, in important scientific fields such as medicinal chemistry and drug discovery, machine learning methods are restricted almost exclusively to the task of performing predictions of large and heterogeneous data sets of chemicals. The lack of interpretability prevents the full exploitation of the machine learning models as generators of new chemical knowledge. This work focuses on the development of an ensemble learning model for the prediction and design of potent dual heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) inhibitors. The model displays accuracy higher than 80% in both training and test sets. To use the ensemble model as a generator of new chemical knowledge, three steps were followed. First, a physicochemical and/or structural interpretation was provided for each molecular descriptor present in the ensemble learning model. Second, the term pseudolinear equation was introduced within the context of machine learning to calculate the relative quantitative contributions of different molecular fragments to the inhibitory activity against the two Hsp90 isoforms studied here. Finally, by assembling the fragments with positive contributions, new molecules were designed, being predicted as potent Hsp90 inhibitors. According to Lipinski's rule of five, the designed molecules were found to exhibit potentially good oral bioavailability, a primordial property that chemicals must have to pass early stages in drug discovery. The present approach based on the combination of ensemble learning and fragment-based topological design holds great promise in drug discovery, and it can be adapted and applied to many different scientific disciplines."

However, identification of these multi-biomarker panels from case and control data is challenging. For example, the exhaustive search method is computationally infeasible when the data dimension is high. Here, we propose a novel method, MILP_k, to identify serum-based multi-biomarker panel to distinguish colorectal cancers (CRC) from benign colorectal tumors. Specifically, the multi-biomarker panel detection problem is modeled by a mixed integer programming to maximize the classification accuracy. Then we measured the serum profiling data for 101 CRC patients and 95 benign patients. The 61 biomarkers were analyzed individually and further their combinations by our method. We discovered 4 biomarkers as the optimal small multi-biomarker panel, including known CRC biomarkers CEA and IL-10 as well as novel biomarkers IMA and NSE. This multi-biomarker panel obtains leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) accuracy to 0.7857 by nearest centroid classifier. An independent test of this panel by support vector machine (SVM) with threefold cross validation gets an AUC 0.8438. This greatly improves the predictive accuracy by 20% over the single best biomarker. Further extension of this 4-biomarker panel to a larger 13-biomarker panel improves the LOOCV to 0.8673 with independent AUC 0.8437. Comparison with the exhaustive search method shows that our method dramatically reduces the searching time by 1000-fold. Experiments on the early cancer stage samples reveal two panel of biomarkers and show promising accuracy. The proposed method allows us to select the subset of biomarkers with best accuracy to distinguish case and control samples given the number of selected biomarkers. Both receiver operating characteristic curve and precision-recall curve show our method's consistent performance gain in accuracy. Our method also shows its advantage in capturing synergy among selected biomarkers. The multi-biomarker panel far outperforms the simple combination of best single features. Close investigation of the multi-biomarker panel illustrates that our method possesses the ability to remove redundancy and reveals complementary biomarker combinations. In addition, our method is efficient and can select multi-biomarker panel with more than 5 biomarkers, for which the exhaustive methods fail. In conclusion, we propose a promising model to improve the clinical data interpretability and to serve as a useful tool for other complex disease studies. Our small multi-biomarker panel, CEA, IL-10, IMA, and NSE, may provide insights on the disease status of colorectal diseases.

Although deep learning algorithms excel in challenging scenarios, their widespread adoption presents a challenge due to their need for more transparency. The advent of Explainable AI (XAI) has addressed this limitation by offering AI -driven systems with attributes such as transparency, interpretability, and reliability. The need for transparency in critical sectors like healthcare has prompted an increased academic focus on investigating and understanding these frameworks. The present paper thoroughly examines the latest research and advancements in Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), specifically focusing on its integration into the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) in healthcare settings. The last section tackles outstanding issues concerning XAI and IoMT and outlines prospective directions for further research. Methods: A thorough investigation was carried out across many scholarly databases and online digital libraries, such as IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, Wiley Interscience, Taylor and Francis, ScienceDirect, Scopus, Springer, Google Scholar, Citeseer Library, Semantic Scholar, and other relevant sources. An analysis was conducted on articles published from March 2004 to February 2024, specifically focusing on AI models that explain different healthcare issues. The search query included Explainable AIin conjunction with Open Black Box, Healthcare, Transparent Models, Interpretable Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Medical Information System, Accountability, Smart Healthcare, and Responsible AI, indicating the field's dynamic nature. The authors also examined various techniques and datasets to elucidate healthcare difficulties, including incorporating the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). Results: The evaluation included more than 105 published models that used clinical data input to diagnose diverse disorders, focusing on incorporating Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) components. In addition to illness diagnosis, these models also elucidate the decisions made. The models were classified according to the input data, used methodologies, and integration of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). The categorization included machine learning and deep learning methodologies, particularly on explainability models connected to the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). These models were classified as model -agnostic, model -specific, global, local, ante -hoc, and post -hoc. Conclusion: This extensive study examines machine learning, and deep learning models developed based on clinical data and associated with the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) for illness detection. These models improve efficiency and accuracy and provide essential assistance to medical personnel. Explaining each choice made by individuals contributes to the acceleration of sickness detection, resulting in decreased medical expenses for patients and healthcare systems.

It intends to offer clinical gland morphometric information and cancer grade classification to be provided as referential opinions for pathologists in order to abate human errors. It embraces enhanced feature learning capability that aids in extraction of potent multi-scale features; efficacious semantic gap recovery during feature concatenation; and successful interception of resolution-degradation and vanishing gradient problems while performing moderate computations. It is proposed by integrating three unique novel structural components namely Hybrid Convolutional Learning Units in the encoder and decoder, Attention Learning Units in skip connection, and Multi-Scalar Dilated Transitional Unit as the transitional layer in the traditional U-Net architecture. These units are composed of the amalgamated phenomenon of multi-level convolutional learning through conventional, atrous, residual, depth-wise, and point-wise convolutions which are further incorporated with target-specific attention learning and enlarged effectual receptive field size. Also, pre-processing techniques of patch-sampling, augmentation (color and morphological), stain-normalization, etc. are employed to burgeon its generalizability. To build network invariance towards digital variability, exhaustive experiments are conducted using three public datasets (Colorectal Adenocarcinoma Gland (CRAG), Gland Segmentation (GlaS) challenge, and Lung Colon-25000 (LC-25K) dataset)) and then its robustness is verified using an in-house private dataset of Hospital Colon (HosC). For the cancer classification, the proposed model achieved results of Accuracy (CRAG(95%), GlaS(97.5%), LC-25K(99.97%), HosC(99.45%)), Precision (CRAG(0.9678), GlaS(0.9768), LC-25K(1), HosC(1)), F1-score (CRAG(0.968), GlaS(0.977), LC 25K(0.9997), HosC(0.9965)), and Recall (CRAG(0.9677), GlaS(0.9767), LC-25K(0.9994), HosC(0.9931)). For the gland detection and segmentation, the proposed model achieved competitive results of F1-score (CRAG(0.924), GlaS(Test A(0.949), Test B(0.918)), LC-25K(0.916), HosC(0.959)); Object-Dice Index (CRAG(0.959), GlaS(Test A(0.956), Test B(0.909)), LC-25K(0.929), HosC(0.922)), and Object-Hausdorff Distance (CRAG(90.47), GlaS(Test A(23.17), Test B(71.53)), LC-25K(96.28), HosC(85.45)). In addition, the activation mappings for testing the interpretability of the classification decision-making process are reported by utilizing techniques of Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations, Occlusion Sensitivity, and Gradient-Weighted Class Activation Mappings. This is done to provide further evidence about the model's self-learning capability of the comparable patterns considered relevant by pathologists without any pre-requisite for annotations. These activation mapping visualization outcomes are evaluated by proficient pathologists, and they delivered these images with a class-path validation score of (CRAG(9.31), GlaS(9.25), LC-25K(9.05), and HosC(9.85)). Furthermore, the seg-path validation score of (GlaS (Test A(9.40), Test B(9.25)), CRAG(9.27), LC-25K(9.01), HosC(9.19)) given by multiple pathologists is included for the final segmented outcomes to substantiate the clinical relevance and suitability for facilitation at the clinical level. The proposed model will aid pathologists to formulate an accurate diagnosis by providing a referential opinion during the morphology assessment of histopathology images. It will reduce unintentional human error in cancer diagnosis and consequently will enhance patient survival rate."

Current machine learning and network-based approaches have issues related to generalization, usability, or model interpretability, especially due to the complexity of target proteins' structure/function, and bias in system training datasets. Here, we propose a new method DRUIDom (DRUg Interacting Domain prediction) to identify bio-interactions between drug candidate compounds and targets by utilizing the domain modularity of proteins, to overcome problems associated with current approaches. DRUIDom is composed of two methodological steps. First, ligands/compounds are statistically mapped to structural domains of their target proteins, with the aim of identifying their interactions. As such, other proteins containing the same mapped domain or domain pair become new candidate targets for the corresponding compounds. Next, a million-scale dataset of small molecule compounds, including those mapped to domains in the previous step, are clustered based on their molecular similarities, and their domain associations are propagated to other compounds within the same clusters. Experimentally verified bioactivity data points, obtained from public databases, are meticulously filtered to construct datasets of active/interacting and inactive/non-interacting drug/compound-target pairs (similar to 2.9M data points), and used as training data for calculating parameters of compound-domain mappings, which led to 27,032 high-confidence associations between 250 domains and 8,165 compounds, and a finalized output of similar to 5 million new compound-protein interactions. DRUIDom is experimentally validated by syntheses and bioactivity analyses of compounds predicted to target LIM-kinase proteins, which play critical roles in the regulation of cell motility, cell cycle progression, and differentiation through actin filament dynamics. We showed that LIMK-inhibitor-2 and its derivatives significantly block the cancer cell migration through inhibition of LIMK phosphorylation and the downstream protein cofilin. One of the derivative compounds (LIMKi-2d) was identified as a promising candidate due to its action on resistant Mahlavu liver cancer cells. The results demonstrated that DRUIDom can be exploited to identify drug candidate compounds for intended targets and to predict new target proteins based on the defined compound-domain relationships.

However, multi-omics networks easily grow into giant hairball structures that hamper biological interpretation. Module detection methods can decompose these networks into smaller interpretable modules. However, these methods are not adapted to deal with multi-omics data nor consider topological features. When deriving very large modules or ignoring the broader network context, interpretability remains limited. To address these issues, we developed a SUbgraph BAsed mulTi-OMIcs Clustering framework (SUBATOMIC), which infers small and interpretable modules with a specific topology while keeping track of connections to other modules and regulators. Results: SUBATOMIC groups specific molecular interactions in composite network subgraphs of two and three nodes and clusters them into topological modules. These are functionally annotated, visualized and overlaid with expression profiles to go from static to dynamic modules. To preserve the larger network context, SUBATOMIC investigates statistically the connections in between modules as well as between modules and regulators such as miRNAs and transcription factors. We applied SUBATOMIC to analyze a composite Homo sapiens network containing transcription factor-target gene, miRNA-target gene, protein-protein, homologous and co-functional interactions from different databases. We derived and annotated 5586 modules with diverse topological, functional and regulatory properties. We created novel functional hypotheses for unannotated genes. Furthermore, we integrated modules with condition specific expression data to study the influence of hypoxia in three cancer cell lines. We developed two prioritization strategies to identify the most relevant modules in specific biological contexts: one considering GO term enrichments and one calculating an activity score reflecting the degree of differential expression. Both strategies yielded modules specifically reacting to low oxygen levels. Conclusions: We developed the SUBATOMIC framework that generates interpretable modules from integrated multi-omics networks and applied it to hypoxia in cancer. SUBATOMIC can infer and contextualize modules, explore condition or disease specific modules, identify regulators and functionally related modules, and derive novel gene functions for uncharacterized genes.

These polyps cause severe conditions in the colon or rectum, presenting a significant diagnostic challenge. Traditional manual detection through medical imaging is not only bulky and prone to errors but also incurs substantial costs, requiring expert endoscopist. Inefficient detection and treatment can lead to critical health complications. Addressing these issues, we extensively employed various configurations of the state-of-the-art YOLOv8 (n-nano, s-small, m-medium, l-large, and x-extra-large) models for effective polyp localization. Complementing this, we proposed a novel TR-SE-Net model for segmentation, integrating Squeeze-and-Excite Networks (SE-Net) to elevate performance and real-time processing capabilities. The Kvasir-SEG dataset is utilized for training and testing models, supplemented by external validation CVC-ClinicDB, PolypGen, ETIS-LaribPolypDB, EDD 2020, and BKAI-IGH to confirm their efficacy in processing unseen, real-time data. This study delves into the interpretability of these models using explainable AI (XAI), such as eigen visualization for localization and heatmap analysis for segmentation. This exploration provides deeper insights into the decision-making processes of the models, thereby enhancing their reliability. Notably, the YOLOv8m model showcased remarkable prediction speed (approximately 16.61 ms) and excelled in precision (0.946), recall (0.771), F1-score (0.85), mAP(50) (0.886), and mAP(50-95) (0.695), catering to diverse clinical scenarios. The TR-SE-Net demonstrated significant improvements in segmentation performances, including DSC (0.8754), F2-score (0.8786), precision (0.9027), recall (0.8879), accuracy (0.9647), competitive mIoU (0.7961), FPS (54), parameters (27.27 million), and flops (10.59 GMac). Furthermore, A graphical Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) system developed utilizing both models can substantially reduce the miss rate because segmentation will assist in polyp detection or vice versa if localization fails. Conclusively, integrating these advanced computer-aided methods substantially enhances colonoscopy procedures by mitigating the risks of colorectal cancer."	"[Ahamed, Md. Faysal; Islam, Md.

Education together with physiotherapy have been shown to lessen pain and disability in chronic pain. Although the evaluation of the patient's competences is a major part of the educational program, the published educational programs rarely describe the tools used to assess competences, especially regarding those related to decision-making and problem-solving. The aim of this study was to provide two competences assessment tools: the cross-cultural adaptation and validation of the Spanish version of the Revised Neurophysiology of Pain Questionnaire (R-NPQ) and practical cases of women with PPBCT. The Spanish cross-cultural adaptation was conducted following recognized criteria. Measurement properties testing included an analysis of construct validity (known-groups approach), reliability (internal consistency and test-retest reliability), responsiveness, interpretability, and feasibility. To promote a tool that would allow evaluation of the educational program competences, a group of experts developed three cases extracted from real contexts by means of an iterative process. A total of 80 women with PPBCT (mean age 56 years) and 81 physiotherapy students (mean age 20 years) participated in the measurement properties analysis. The three developed cases were presented to the same 80 women with PPBCT before and after the educational program. As we expected, students showed a significantly higher score (p < 0.001) than did women with PPBCT in the R-NPQ questionnaire, with a large effect size (d = 2.49), demonstrating good construct validity. The Cronbach alpha was 0.90 (95% CI, 0.87-0.92) and the intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.82 (95% CI, 0.73-0.88). A large effect size (5.2) was found, as we expected, between baseline and post-treatment scores, suggesting adequate responsiveness. In addition, identifying and analyzing, decision making, communicating needs, knowing how to manage, and problem-solving skills were evaluated through the three practical cases. Most women (88.75%) reached the highest level in the assessment rubric of the proposed practical cases. The Spanish R-NPQ is a comprehensible, valid, reliable, and responsive tool for Spanish women with PPBCT. The practical cases are a useful competence assessment tool and were well accepted by women with PPBCT. Further studies are needed to investigate more competence assessment tools and to investigate whether the achievement of different levels of competences has an effect on health behaviors."

Method This is a nationwide panel ecological study, including 916 CEO. Data from interviews with managers and dentists of the CEO were used, including variables related to training on OC, clinical protocols, biopsies, referral for diagnosis and treatment, and registration of users with OC. We carried out Latent Transition Analysis (LTA) to identify patterns (latent status LS) of service adequacy and work processes' changes between the two assessment cycles. We tested models with three, four, and five LS, selecting the one with the best conceptual interpretability and good model fit parameters. Data from the LS were plotted on choropleth and hotspots maps in Brazil allowing us to identify areas with the better or worse provision of specialized OC services. Results The model with four LS was chosen. The four LS were named: 1.'Most indicators inadequate for OC care' (the worst); 2. 'Most indicators suitable for OC care' (the best); 3. 'CEO with a poor relation with Primary Health Care (PHC) services'; and 4. 'CEO with a poor relation with tertiary hospital services'. The comparison of the LS transition between the two cycles revealed that 419 (45.7%) CEO remained in the same LS (1 -> 1, 3 -> 4, 2 -> 2); 228 (24.9%) switched to a worse status (2 -> 1, 2 -> 4, 3 -> 1) and 269 (29.4%) switched to a better LS (1 -> 2, 1 -> 4, 3 -> 2). While the majority of the CEO improved, we identified a decline of 17.8% in those who reported performing biopsies and 18.3% in the number of CEO that had hospitals for referring confirmed OC cases. Almost all Brazilian states had CEO that improved the work process. The Southeast and South regions had the highest percentage of CEO with the better work process in both cycles. Hotspots showed areas concentrating improvements in the work process in the Northeast region. However, some hotspots in the North revealed some CEO where the work process deteriorated or remained unsatisfactory. Conclusions There are regional inequities in the provision of OC care in CEO. Most services improved their work process or remained stable. However, the biopsies and the referral to hospital care for confirmed cases declined, indicating that CEO need to improve planning and care provision to reduce OC morbimortality."

Assessment of Neurocognitive Impairment and Speech Functioning Before Head and Neck Cancer Treatment	JAMA OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD & NECK SURGERY			English	Article							QUALITY-OF-LIFE; COGNITIVE FUNCTION; CHEMORADIATION; PREVALENCE; MEMORY; INDEX	"IMPORTANCE Head and neck cancer (HNC) and its treatment may negatively alter neurocognitive and speech functioning. However, the prevalence of neurocognitive impairment among patients with HNC before treatment is poorly studied, and the association between neurocognitive and speech functioning is unknown, which hampers good interpretability of the effect of HNC treatment on neurocognitive and speech function. OBJECTIVES To document neurocognitive functioning in patients with HNC before treatment and to investigate the association between neurocognitive and speech functioning. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Prospective cohort study of newly diagnosed patients with HNC before treatment using a large sample obtained in a nationwide, multicenter setting (Netherlands Quality of Life and Biomedical Cohort Study in Head and Neck Cancer [NET-QUBIC] project). MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES Objective neuropsychological measures of delayed recall, letter fluency, and executive functioning, as well as patient-reported outcome measures on neurocognitive speech and functioning, were collected before treatment. RESULTS In total, 254 patients with HNC participated (71.7% male), with a mean (SD) age of 62 (10) years. The response rate ranged from 81.9% (208 of 254) to 84.6%(215 of 254). Objective neurocognitive measures indicated that 4.7%(10 of 212) to 15.0%(32 of 214) of patients were initially seen with moderate to severe cognitive impairment. Mild to moderate impairment was found in 12.3%(26 of 212) to 26.2%(56 of 214) of patients. The most altered domains were delayed recall and letter fluency. Seven percent (15 of 208) of the patients reported high levels of everyday neurocognitive failure, and 42.6%(89 of 209) reported speech problems. Objective neurocognitive function was not significantly associated with patient-reported neurocognitive or speech functioning, but the results from patient-reported outcome measures were significantly correlated. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Results of this study demonstrate a high prevalence of impaired speech functioning among patients with HNC before treatment, which is in line with previous findings. A novel finding is that neurocognitive impairment is also highly prevalent as objectively measured and as self-perceived. Understanding the reason why patients with HNC are initially seen with neurocognitive impairment before the start of treatment is important because this impairment may complicate patient-clinician interaction and alter treatment adherence and because treatment itself may further worsen cognitive functioning. In addition, low self-perceived neurocognitive and speech functioning before treatment may decrease a patient's confidence in communicative participation and perceived quality of life. Disentangling the associations between objective and patient-reported neurocognitive and speech functions is an important area for future research."	"[Piai, Vitoria; Kessels, Roy P.

SANEpool successfully addresses the limitations of the un-transparency in the prediction process of previous computational AI models for drug synergy prediction, while providing the superior predictive performance than popular baselines on numerous drug-synergy prediction datasets. The success of SANEpool indicates that significant gene-gene interactions and gene-drug interactions play a crucial role in designing powerful deep learning models to provide accurate prediction and to reveal the mechanism of the synergy (MoS).Abstract Synergistic drug combinations provide huge potentials to enhance therapeutic efficacy and to reduce adverse reactions. However, effective and synergistic drug combination prediction remains an open question because of the unknown causal disease signaling pathways. Though various deep learning (AI) models have been proposed to quantitatively predict the synergism of drug combinations, the major limitation of existing deep learning methods is that they are inherently not interpretable, which makes the conclusions of AI models untransparent to human experts, henceforth limiting the robustness of the model conclusion and the implementation ability of these models in real-world human-AI healthcare. In this paper, we develop an interpretable graph neural network (GNN) that reveals the underlying essential therapeutic targets and the mechanism of the synergy (MoS) by mining the sub-molecular network of great importance. The key point of the interpretable GNN prediction model is a novel graph pooling layer, a self-attention-based node and edge pool (henceforth SANEpool), that can compute the attention score (importance) of genes and connections based on the genomic features and topology. As such, the proposed GNN model provides a systematic way to predict and interpret the drug combination synergism based on the detected crucial sub-molecular network. Experiments on various well-adopted drug-synergy-prediction datasets demonstrate that (1) the SANEpool model has superior predictive ability to generate accurate synergy score prediction, and (2) the sub-molecular networks detected by the SANEpool are self-explainable and salient for identifying synergistic drug combinations."

However, randomized trials often fail to provide evidence for their effectiveness with regard to patient-reported outcomes. Stress biomarkers could complement self-report data, but little is known about their feasibility, acceptance, and interpretability. Methods: Therefore, we designed a randomized crossover trial in which 42 patients in a palliative care unit participated in both a brief mindfulness intervention (MI) and a resting state control condition (CC) on two consecutive afternoons. On each day, we collected four saliva samples in 20-min intervals using Salivettes (c) to determine salivary cortisol (sCort) and alpha-amylase (sAA) concentration levels. At all measurement points, self-rated well-being and stress as well as cardiovascular markers were assessed. Baseline measurements further included self-rated quality of life and clinician-rated functional status. Results: 78.6% of the patients provided the maximum number of 8 saliva samples and 62.2% reported no subjective difficulties with the sampling procedures. 66.6% (sCort) and 69.6% (sAA) of all possible samples were finally included in the analysis. Xerostomia and nausea were the main reasons for missing data. Higher sCort levels were associated with higher heart rate and lower quality of life, functional status, and heart rate variability. Corticosteroid and sedative medication as well as time since last meal were identified as potential confounders. Regarding reactivity to the MI, we found an overall decrease in sCort levels over time (b = -.03, p =.01), but this effect did not differ significantly between the study conditions (b =.03, p =.21). sAA levels were higher in men than in women. Trajectories over time did not significantly differ between the two conditions (b = -.02, p =.80) and associations with other stress and health-related constructs were weak. Conclusions: Findings indicate that sCort might serve as a psychobiological outcome in future palliative care trials. However, future research should refine the exact measurement and conceptualization strategies for sCort in palliative care research. High attrition rates should be expected in patients with xerostomia or nausea."

The complex production process and manual detection process of pathological sections make pathological detection subjective and inefficient. Polarization imaging technology is sensitive to sub wavelength structures, and exploring an objective and efficient method for identifying cancerous tissue using polarization images has unique advantages in enhancing pathological diagnostic capabilities. In this article, based on the Muller matrix measurement scheme of double wave plate rotation method, a backscatter polarization imaging system is built and upgrated equipped with a tunable zoom microscope lens to meet the requirements of different resolution fields. The slice data of unstained lung cancer and basal cell cancerare collected, and the Muller matrix is obtained from 30 polarization intensity images based on the Fourier coefficient relationship. In order to enhance the interpretability and strong correlation of the original data analysis paradigm in which the meaning of the Mueller matrix elements is unclear and the interpretation of the information for a single polarization parameter is limited, we report a polarization multi-parameter feature recognition and texture feature analysis method for cancerous tissue. To overcome the limitation that a single Muller matrix image cannot accurately and comprehensively identify the structure of pathological tissue, we introduce rotation invariants to obtain a high-dimensional polarization parameter set, then select regions of interest randomly and generate polarization multi-parameter feature curves to achieve multi-dimensional feature extraction and visualization of pathological regions, solving the problem of direct use of Muller matrix affected by direction. At the same time, in order to further obtain organizational information from derived parameters, 4 texture attributes from gray level co-occurrence matrix and 6 texture attributes from Tamura are calculated to assist in quantitative analysis. The proposed method is experimental verified, the following results are obtained: the characteristic curves of polarization parameter set obtained from 20 random samples in the normal and cancerous regions of lung cancer have a very high degree of overlap respectively, indicating that the polarization characteristics of the same type of tissue are generally similar, but appear to be significantly different in comparison, which perfectly conforms the previous analysis of a single parameter. The visualized polarization multi-parameter feature curve displays the complete polarization characteristics of normal and cancerous tissue of lung cancer in a very concise and clear manner, while also clearly showing the difference in curve trends between normal and cancerous tissue. This method is also applicable to basal cell carcinoma. The information distribution characteristics of normal and cancerous tissue of lung cancer are analyzed by fixing the texture dimension and polarization dimension respectively. When the texture feature is fixed, each polarization parameter has different degrees of discrimination effect. For example, when the contrast attribute is fixed, all the polarization parameters except for the parameter indicating linear polarization ability have good discrimination for lung cancer tissue and can be used as auxiliary tools for quantitative analysis; when the polarization dimension is fixed, the distribution of values for different textures on normal and cancerous tissue is different. For example, for the parameter indicating the angle of phase delay, the texture contrast, correlation, energy, and homogeneity of cancerous tissue are generally higher than those of normal tissue, and their corresponding six Tamura features have good discrimination, all of which have the potential to be used for quantitative analysis. According to the above research process and results, the fitted polarization multi-parameter feature curve restores the original high-dimensional polarization parameter set to two demensions, which can visually and efficiently identify the distribution of polarization differences between normal and cancerous tissue, and can intuitively obtain the information about the differences between different types of tissues in various polarization dimensions. At the same time, the results of texture analysis of lung cancer show that when the texture dimension is fixed, a single texture attribute can be a common quantitative indicator for multiple polarization images; when the polarization dimension is fixed, different texture attributes are expected to be multiple auxiliary quantitative indicators for a single polarization dimension. This method is fast and efficient, providing a new idea for auxiliary pathological detection and demonstrating good application prospects in clinical practice."

Methods: Core databases were searched for studies that were based on endoscopic imaging, used CAD models for the histologic diagnosis of diminutive colorectal polyps, and presented data on diagnostic performance. A systematic review and diagnostic test accuracy meta-analysis were performed. Results: Overall, 13 studies were included. The pooled area under the curve, sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic odds ratio of CAD models for the diagnosis of diminutive colorectal polyps (adenomatous or neoplastic vs nonadenomatous or nonneoplastic) were 0.96 (95% CI 0.93-0.97), 0.93 (95% CI 0.91-0.95), 0.87 (95% CI 0.76-0.93), and 87 (95% CI 38-201), respectively. The meta-regression analysis showed no heterogeneity, and no publication bias was detected. Subgroup analyses showed robust results. The negative predictive value of CAD models for the diagnosis of adenomatous polyps in the rectosigmoid colon was 0.96 (95% CI 0.95-0.97), and this value exceeded the threshold of the diagnosis and leave strategy. Conclusions: CAD models show potential for the optical histological diagnosis of diminutive colorectal polyps via the use of endoscopic images."

A methodological limitation of such studies is their high attrition rate, particularly owing to participants who stop responding after initial study enrollment. Importantly, study dropout can introduce systematic biases that may affect the interpretability of results. Objective: Based on a previously collected sample (baseline n=654), here we investigated potential determinants of study attrition in web-based prospective studies on psychedelic use. Methods: Logistic regression models were used to examine demographic, psychological trait and state, and psychedelic-specific predictors of dropout. Predictors were assessed 1 week before, 1 day after, and 2 weeks after psychedelic use, with attrition being defined as noncompletion of the key endpoint 4 weeks post experience. Results: Predictors of attrition were found among demographic variables including age (beta=0.024; P=.007) and educational levels, as well as personality traits, specifically conscientiousness (beta=-0.079; P=.02) and extraversion (beta=0.082; P=.01). Contrary to prior hypotheses, neither baseline attitudes toward psychedelics nor the intensity of acute challenging experiences were predictive of dropout. Conclusions: The baseline predictors of attrition identified here are consistent with those reported in longitudinal studies in other scientific disciplines, suggesting their transdisciplinary relevance. Moreover, the lack of an association between attrition and psychedelic advocacy or negative drug experiences in our sample contextualizes concerns about problematic biases in these and related data."

Recently, there has been an increasing number of studies evaluating the feasibility of utilizing H&E WSIs for determining HER2 status through innovative data-driven deep learning methods, taking advantage of the ubiquitous availability of H&E WSIs. One of the main challenges with these data-driven methods is the need for large-scale datasets with high quality annotations, which can be expensive to curate. Therefore, in this study, we explored both the region-of-interest (ROI)-based supervised and the attention-based multiple-instance-learning (MIL) weakly supervised methods for predicting HER2 status on H&E WSIs to evaluate whether avoiding labor-intensive tumor annotation will compromise the final prediction performance. The ROI-based method involved an Inception-v3 along with an aggregation step to combine the patch-level predictions into a WSI-level prediction. On the other hand, the attention-based MIL methods explored ImageNet pretrained ResNet, H&E image pretrained ResNet, and H&E image pretrained vision transformer (ViT) as encoders for WSI-level HER2 prediction. Experiments are carried out on N = 355 WSIs available in public domain with HER2 status determined by IHC and ISH and annotations of breast invasive carcinoma. The dataset was split into training/validation/test set with 80/10/10 ratio. Our results demonstrate that the attention-based ViT MIL method is able to reach similar accuracy as the ROI-based method on the independent test set (AUC of 0.79 (95% CI: 0.63-0.95) versus 0.88 (95% CI: 0.63-0.9) respectively), and thus reduces the burden of labor-intensive annotations. Furthermore, the attention mechanism enhances interpretability of the results and offers insights into the reliability of the predictions."

Unfortunately, current breast imaging techniques all suffer from certain limitations: they are either not fully three dimensional, have an insufficient resolution or low soft-tissue contrast. Grating interferometry breast computed tomography (GI-BCT) is a promising X-ray phase contrast modality that could overcome these limitations by offering high soft-tissue contrast and excellent three-dimensional resolution. To enable the transition of this technology to clinical practice, dedicated data-processing algorithms must be developed in order to effectively retrieve the signals of interest from the measured raw data. Methods This article proposes a novel denoising algorithm that can cope with the high-noise amplitudes and heteroscedasticity which arise in GI-BCT when operated in a low-dose regime to effectively regularize the ill-conditioned GI-BCT inverse problem. We present a data-driven algorithm called INSIDEnet, which combines different ideas such as multiscale image processing, transform-domain filtering, transform learning, and explicit orthogonality to build an Interpretable NonexpanSIve Data-Efficient network (INSIDEnet). Results We apply the method to simulated breast phantom datasets and to real data acquired on a GI-BCT prototype and show that the proposed algorithm outperforms traditional state-of-the-art filters and is competitive with deep neural networks. The strong inductive bias given by the proposed model's architecture allows to reliably train the algorithm with very limited data while providing high model interpretability, thus offering a great advantage over classical convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Conclusions The proposed INSIDEnet is highly data-efficient, interpretable, and outperforms state-of-the-art CNNs when trained on very limited training data. We expect the proposed method to become an important tool as part of a dedicated plug-and-play GI-BCT reconstruction framework, needed to translate this promising technology to the clinics."

In the meantime, biomedicine has been presented as one of the pressing challenges of the 21st century. The inversion of the age pyramid, the increase in longevity, and the negative environment due to pollution and bad habits of the population have led to a necessity of research in the methodologies that can help to mitigate and fight against these changes.The combination of both fields has already achieved remarkable results in drug discovery, cancer prediction or gene activation. However, challenges such as data labelling, architecture improvements, interpretability of the models and translational implementation of the proposals still remain. In haematology, conventional protocols follow a stepwise approach that includes several tests and doctor-patient interactions to make a diagnosis. This procedure results in sig-nificant costs and workload for hospitals.In this paper, we present an artificial intelligence model based on neural networks to support practitioners in the identification of different haematological diseases using only rutinary and inexpensive blood count tests. In particular, we present both binary and multiclass classification of haematological diseases using a specialised neural network architecture where data is studied and combined along it, taking into account the clinical knowledge of the problem, obtaining results up to 96% accuracy for the binary classification experiment. Furthermore, we compare this method against traditional machine learning algorithms such as gradient boosting decision trees and transformers for tabular data. The use of these machine learning techniques could reduce the cost and decision time and improve the quality of life for both specialists and patients while producing more precise diagnoses."

Previous researches have demonstrated that AI-based tumor pathology may help to solve the challenges faced by traditional pathology. This technology has attracted the attention of scholars in many fields and a large amount of articles have been published. This study mainly summarizes the knowledge structure of AI-based tumor pathology through bibliometric analysis, and discusses the potential research trends and foci. Methods Publications related to AI-based tumor pathology from 1999 to 2021 were selected from Web of Science Core Collection. VOSviewer and Citespace were mainly used to perform and visualize co-authorship, co-citation, and co-occurrence analysis of countries, institutions, authors, references and keywords in this field. Results A total of 2753 papers were included. The papers on AI-based tumor pathology research had been continuously increased since 1999. The United States made the largest contribution in this field, in terms of publications (1138, 41.34%), H-index (85) and total citations (35,539 times). We identified the most productive institution and author were Harvard Medical School and Madabhushi Anant, while Jemal Ahmedin was the most co-cited author. Scientific Reports was the most prominent journal and after analysis, Lecture Notes in Computer Science was the journal with highest total link strength. According to the result of references and keywords analysis, breast cancer histopathology convolutional neural network and histopathological image were identified as the major future research foci. Conclusions AI-based tumor pathology is in the stage of vigorous development and has a bright prospect. International transboundary cooperation among countries and institutions should be strengthened in the future. It is foreseeable that more research foci will be lied in the interpretability of deep learning-based model and the development of multi-modal fusion model."

This systematic literature review aimed to identify exploratory methods on DP in pan-European studies and to inform the development of the DEterminants of DIet and Physical ACtivity (DEDIPAC) toolbox of methods suitable for use in future European studies. The search was conducted in three databases on prospective studies in healthy, free-living people across the whole life span. To identify validated DP methods, an additional search without regional restrictions was conducted. Studies including at least two European countries were retained. The search resulted in six pan-European studies applying principal component/factor analysis (PC/FA) (n 5) or cluster analysis (n 2). The criteria to retain PC/factors ranged from the application of the eigenvalue>1 criterion, the scree plot and/or the interpretability criterion. Furthermore, seven validation studies were identified: DP, derived by PC/FA (n 6) or reduced rank regression (RRR) (n 1) were compared using dietary information from FFQ (n 6) or dietary history (n 1) as study instrument and dietary records (n 6) or 24-h dietary recalls (n 1) as reference. The correlation coefficients for the derived DP ranged from modest to high.

J	"Li, XT; Wong, KC"				"Li, Xiangtao; Wong, Ka-Chun"			Evolutionary Multiobjective Clustering and Its Applications to Patient Stratification	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CYBERNETICS			English	Article						Clustering; density peaks; multiobjective optimization; patient stratification	GENE-EXPRESSION DATA; CANCER SUBTYPES; ALGORITHM; VALIDITY; OPTIMIZATION; PERFORMANCE	"Patient stratification has a major role in enabling efficient and personalized medicine. An important task in patient stratification is to discover disease subtypes for effective treatment. To achieve this goal, the research on clustering algorithms for patient stratification has brought attention from both academia and medical community over the past decades. However, existing clustering algorithms suffer from realistic restrictions such as experimental noises, high dimensionality, and poor interpretability. In particular, the existing clustering algorithms usually determine clustering quality using only one internal evaluation function. Unfortunately, it is obvious that one internal evaluation function is hard to be fitted and robust for all datasets. Therefore, in this paper, a novel multiobjective framework called multiobjective clustering algorithm by fast search and find of density peaks is proposed to address those limitations altogether. In the proposed framework, a parameter candidate population is evolved under multiple objectives to select features and evaluate clustering densities automatically. To guide the multiobjective evolution, five cluster validity indices including compactness, separation, Calinski-Harabasz index, Davies-Bouldin index, and Dunn index, are chosen as the objective functions, capturing multiple characteristics of the evolving clusters. Multiobjective differential evolution algorithm based on decomposition is adopted to optimize those five objective functions simultaneously. To demonstrate its effectiveness, extensive experiments have been conducted, comparing the proposed algorithm with 45 algorithms including nine state-of-the-art clustering algorithms, five multiobjective evolutionary algorithms, and 31 baseline algorithms under different objective subsets on 94 datasets featuring 35 real patient stratification datasets, 55 synthetic datasets based on a real human transcription regulation network model, and four other medical datasets. The numerical results reveal that the proposed algorithm can achieve better or competitive solutions than the others. Besides, time complexity analysis, convergence analysis, and parameter analysis are conducted to demonstrate the robustness of the proposed algorithm from different perspectives."

We investigated the interpretability of current PRO data presentation formats. This cross-sectional mixed-methods study randomized purposively sampled cancer patients and clinicians to evaluate six group-data or four individual-data formats. A self-directed exercise assessed participants' interpretation accuracy and ratings of ease-of-understanding and usefulness (0 = least to 10 = most) of each format. Semi-structured qualitative interviews explored helpful and confusing format attributes. We reached thematic saturation with 50 patients (44 % < college graduate) and 20 clinicians. For group-level data, patients rated simple line graphs highest for ease-of-understanding and usefulness (median 8.0; 33 % selected for easiest to understand/most useful) and clinicians rated simple line graphs highest for ease-of-understanding and usefulness (median 9.0, 8.5) but most often selected line graphs with confidence limits or norms (30 % for each format for easiest to understand/most useful). Qualitative results support that clinicians value confidence intervals, norms, and p values, but patients find them confusing. For individual-level data, both patients and clinicians rated line graphs highest for ease-of-understanding (median 8.0 patients, 8.5 clinicians) and usefulness (median 8.0, 9.0) and selected them as easiest to understand (50, 70 %) and most useful (62, 80 %). The qualitative interviews supported highlighting scores requiring clinical attention and providing reference values. This study has identified preferences and opportunities for improving on current formats for PRO presentation and will inform development of best practices for PRO presentation. Both patients and clinicians prefer line graphs across group-level data and individual-level data formats, but clinicians prefer greater detail (e.g., statistical details) for group-level data."

When a polyp fragments, the pathologist cannot determine resection completeness. Alternative approaches to reduce polyp fragmentation include reducing shearing forces on the polyp or removing polyps through the instrument channel. The primary aim of this study was to assess fragmentation of polyps extracted using different approaches from conventional polyp retrieval. Methods: Polyps (5-15 mm) resected by cold snare or cautery by 3 colonoscopists were extracted from the colonoscope using 1 of 4 techniques. Method I was the conventional method of pressing the suction valve button and retrieving the polyp through a trap. Method II involved removing the suction valve, covering the open suction valve cylinder with a finger. Method III used a Roth Net polyp retriever placed through the instrument channel. Method IV involved connecting a polyp trap to suction onto the instrument channel port. Fragmentation was defined as multiple pieces of the specimen in formalin, as grossly described by the pathologist. Alternative approaches (methods II, III, and IV) were all compared with the conventional method (method I). Results: The method I fragmentation rate of polyps was 60.3% (123/204). Method II extraction reduced fragmentation to 43.0% (52/121, P = .003), proving that fragmentation occurs with passage through the suction valve channel. Method III had a lower fragmentation rate of 23.1% (6/26, P < .001). Method IV likewise showed a reduced fragmentation rate of 18.5% (5/27, P < .001). Conclusions: Polyp fragmentation is reduced by removal of the suction valve button. There is also a decrease in fragmentation rates in removing the polyp by connecting the polyp trap to the instrument port. Our study suggests that decreasing polyp fragmentation and improving pathology margin interpretability is possible through methods that extract polyps through the instrument port with currently available devices."

Communication Accommodation Theory (CAT) posits that an individual's goals drive their communication behavior. The way in which pharmacists communicate with patients may be determined by the goals they set for these medication counseling sessions. Objectives: To examine hospital pharmacists' goals in patient medication counseling within the CAT framework. Methods: Hospital pharmacist focus groups were held in two teaching hospitals. Interested pharmacists attended a focus group designed to elicit their goals in patient medication counseling. Focus groups were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. NVivo software was used to assist in coding and organization. The codes were reviewed for reliability by pharmacists independent of the focus groups. An inductive thematic analysis was applied to the data. Results: Six 1 h focus groups were conducted with a total of 24 pharmacists participating. Saturation of information was achieved after four focus groups. Greater than 80% consensus was achieved for reliability of the identified codes. Patient-centered themes constructed from these codes were to build rapport, to empower patients and to improve patients' experience, health and safety. Exemplars provided by pharmacists for the goals of building rapport and empowering patients were aligned with five CAT communication behaviors (approximation, interpretability, discourse management, emotional expression and interpersonal control). Conclusions: Patient-centered goals described by hospital pharmacists for medication counseling aligned well with CAT behaviors necessary for effective communication. Further research using the CAT framework to examine the effectiveness of hospital pharmacist-patient exchanges that include both participants' perspectives is required to better understand how well pharmacists communicate with patients.

Machine Learning (ML) is a powerful tool for computing these complex associations and accurately predicting chronic health conditions.Methods Using the 2021 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey, we developed several ML models-random forest, logistic regression, support vector machine, Naive Bayes, and K-Nearest Neighbor-over data from a sample of 52,268 respondents. We predicted 13 chronic health conditions based on ACE history, health behaviors, SDoH, and demographics. We further assessed each variable's importance in outcome prediction for model interpretability. We evaluated model performance via the Area Under the Curve (AUC) score.Results With the inclusion of data on ACEs, our models outperformed or demonstrated similar accuracies to existing models in the literature that used SDoH to predict health outcomes. The most accurate models predicted diabetes, pulmonary diseases, and heart attacks. The random forest model was the most effective for diabetes (AUC = 0.784) and heart attacks (AUC = 0.732), and the logistic regression model most accurately predicted pulmonary diseases (AUC = 0.753). The strongest predictors across models were age, ever monitored blood sugar or blood pressure, count of the monitoring behaviors for blood sugar or blood pressure, BMI, time of last cholesterol check, employment status, income, count of vaccines received, health insurance status, and total ACEs. A cumulative measure of ACEs was a stronger predictor than individual ACEs.Discussion Our models can provide an interpretable, trauma-informed framework to identify and intervene with at-risk individuals early to prevent chronic health conditions and address their inequalities in the U.S."	"[Afzal, Hanin B.] Univ Toronto, Dept Mech & Ind Engn, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Jahangir, Tasfia] Emory Univ, Rollins Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Behav Social & Hlth Educ Sci, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Mei, Yiyang] Emory Univ, Sch Law, Atlanta, GA USA; [Madden, Annabelle] Columbia Univ, Teachers Coll, New York, NY USA; [Sarker, Abeed] Emory Univ, Dept Biomed Informat, Sch Med, Atlanta, GA USA; [Kim, Sangmi] Emory Univ, Nell Hodgson Woodruff Sch Nursing, Atlanta, GA USA"	University of Toronto; Emory University; Rollins School Public Health; Emory University; Columbia University Teachers College; Columbia University; Emory University; Emory University	"Jahangir, T (corresponding author), Emory Univ, Rollins Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Behav Social & Hlth Educ Sci, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA."	tasfia.jahangir@emory.edu	"Sarker, Abeed/W-1044-2019"		National Institute of Nursing Research of the National Institutes of Health [K01NR019651]	National Institute of Nursing Research of the National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Nursing Research (NINR))	"The author(s) declare financial support was received for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.

Although some biomarkers of relapse are utilized in the clinic, their ability to predict outcomes in high-risk patients is limited. Here, we propose a random survival forest (RSF) machine learning model utilizing interpretable genomic inputs to predict relapse/death in high-risk pediatric B-ALL patients. We utilized whole exome sequencing profiles from 156 patients in the TARGET-ALL study (with samples collected at presentation) further stratified into training and test cohorts (109 and 47 patients, respectively). To avoid overfitting and facilitate the interpretation of machine learning results, input genomic variables were engineered using a stepwise approach involving univariable Cox models to select variables directly associated with outcomes, genomic coordinate-based analysis to select mutational hotspots, and correlation analysis to eliminate feature co-linearity. Model training identified 7 genomic regions most predictive of relapse/death-free survival. The test cohort error rate was 12.47%, and a polygenic score based on the sum of the top 7 variables effectively stratified patients into two groups, with significant differences in time to relapse/death (log-rank P = 0.001, hazard ratio = 5.41). Our model outperformed other EFS modeling approaches including an RSF using gold-standard prognostic variables (error rate = 24.35%). Validation in 174 standard-risk patients and 3 patients who failed to respond to induction therapy confirmed that our RSF model and polygenic score were specific to high-risk disease. We propose that our feature selection/engineering approach can increase the clinical interpretability of RSF, and our polygenic score could be utilized for enhance clinical decision-making in high-risk B-ALL.

Computed Tomography Radiomics to Differentiate Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma and Hepatocellular Carcinoma	CLINICAL ONCOLOGY			English	Article						Artificial intelligence; Biomarkers; Hepatocellular carcinoma; Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma; Machine learning; Predictive medicine	PRIMARY LIVER-CANCER; DIAGNOSIS; MANAGEMENT; IMAGES	"Aims: Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) differ in prognosis and treatment. We aimed to non-invasively differentiate iCCA and HCC by means of radiomics extracted from contrast-enhanced standard-of-care computed tomography (CT). Materials and methods: In total, 94 patients (male, n = 68, mean age 63.3 +/- 12.4 years) with histologically confirmed iCCA (n = 47) or HCC (n = 47) who underwent contrast-enhanced abdominal CT between August 2014 and November 2021 were retrospectively included. The enhancing tumour border was manually segmented in a clinically feasible way by defining three three-dimensional volumes of interest per tumour. Radiomics features were extracted. Intraclass correlation analysis and Pearson metrics were used to stratify robust and non-redundant features with further feature reduction by LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator). Independent training and testing datasets were used to build four different machine learning models. Performance metrics and feature importance values were computed to increase the models' interpretability. Results: The patient population was split into 65 patients for training (iCCA, n = 32) and 29 patients for testing (iCCA, n = 15). A final combined feature set of three radiomics features and the clinical features age and sex revealed a top test model performance of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) = 0.82 (95% confidence interval = 0.66-0.98; train ROC AUC = 0.82) using a logistic regression classifier. The model was well calibrated, and the Youden J Index suggested an optimal cut-off of 0.501 to discriminate between iCCA and HCC with a sensitivity of 0.733 and a specificity of 0.857. Conclusions: Radiomics-based imaging biomarkers can potentially help to non-invasively discriminate between iCCA and HCC.

The commonly used Caprini model is limited by its inadequate ability to discriminate between risk stratums on the surgical population in southwest China and lengthy risk factors. The purpose of this study was to establish an improved VTE risk assessment model that is accurate and simple. Methods This study is based on the clinical data from 81,505 surgical patients hospitalized in the Southwest Hospital of China between January 1, 2019 and June 18, 2021. Among the population, 559 patients developed VTE. An improved VTE risk assessment model, SW-model, was established through Logistic Regression, with comparisons to both Caprini and Random Forest. Results The SW-model incorporated eight risk factors. The area under the curve (AUC) of SW-model (0.807 [0.758, 0.853], 0.804 [0.765, 0.840]), are significantly superior (p = 0.001 and p = 0.044) to those of the Caprini (0.705 [0.652, 0.757], 0.758 [0.719, 0795]) on two test sets, but inferior (p < 0.001 and p = 0.002) to Random Forest (0.854 [0.814, 0.890], 0.839 [0.806, 0.868]). In decision curve analysis, within threshold range from 0.015 to 0.04, the DCA curves of the SW-model are superior to Caprini and two default strategies. Conclusions The SW-model demonstrated a higher discriminative capability to distinguish VTE positive in surgical patients compared with the Caprini model. Compared to Random Forest, Logistic Regression based SW-model provided interpretability which is essential in guarantee the procedure of risk assessment transparent to clinicians."

An objective and reliable assessment of dietary exposures should rely on combinations of methodologies including frequency questionnaires, short-term recalls or records, together with biological samples to evaluate markers of intake or status and to identify genetic susceptibilities. In an attempt to present current knowledge on how genetic fingerprints contribute to an individual's nutritional status, we present a review of current literature describing associations between genetic variants and levels of well-established biomarkers of vitamin status in free-living and generally healthy individuals. Based on the outcomes of candidate gene, genome-wide-association studies and meta-analyses thereof, we have identified several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) involved in the vitamins' metabolic pathways. Polymorphisms in genes encoding proteins involved in vitamin metabolism and transport are reported to have an impact on vitamin D status; while genetic variants of vitamin D receptor were most frequently associated with health outcomes. Genetic variations that can influence vitamin E status include SNPs involved in its uptake and transport, such as in SCAR-B1 gene, and in lipoprotein metabolism. Variants of the genes encoding the sodium-dependent vitamin C transport proteins are greatly associated with the body's status on vitamin C. Regarding the vitamins of the B-complex, special reference is made to the widely studied variant in the MTHFR gene. Methodological attributes of genetic studies that may limit the comparability and interpretability of the findings are also discussed. Our understanding of how genes affect our responses to nutritional triggers will enhance our capacity to evaluate dietary exposure and design personalized nutrition programs to sustain health and prevent disease."

Modified European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Guidelines were used for translation and cultural adaptation. Of 212 eligible Norwegian women who consented to participate, 205 completed the questionnaires, of whom 50 were retested after 1 - 3 weeks, and 76 were tested 6 months after surgery. Reliability, validity and responsiveness were evaluated. Additionally, interpretability, the smallest detectable change, the standard error of measurement, floor and ceiling effects, and the percentages of missing items are reported. Reliability ranged from 0.66 to 0.93 and intraclass correlation coefficients from 0.85 to 0.94. Both construct validity and responsiveness were found to be adequate. The responsiveness of the PFDI-20 was further supported by areas under the curve above 0.70. Estimates were lower for the PFIQ-7. The smallest detectable changes at the individual level were 15 - 21 % and 17 - 27 % for the PFDI-20 and PFIQ-7, respectively. The absolute values of the minimal important changes in the total scores were 48 and 47, respectively. No floor or ceiling effects were evident in the distributions of the PFDI-20 and PFIQ-7 total scores. The translated questionnaires provided adequate reliability, validity and good responsiveness to change. These short versions of the PFDI and PFIQ are robust measuring instruments that will enable symptom severity and health-related quality of life to be evaluated in the Norwegian context."

A multi-center study conducted in China revealed a median progression-free survival (PFS) of 7.1 months. However, the prediction of response duration to this immunotherapy has not been thoroughly investigated. Additionally, the potential of baseline laboratory features in predicting PFS remains largely unexplored. Therefore, we developed an interpretable machine learning (ML) framework, iPFS-SC, aimed at predicting PFS using baseline (pre-treatment) laboratory features and providing interpretations of the predictions.Materials and methods A cohort of 146 patients with advanced GC/GEJC, along with their baseline laboratory features, was included in the iPFS-SC framework. Through a forward feature selection process, predictive baseline features were identified, and four ML algorithms were developed to categorize PFS duration based on a threshold of 7.1 months. Furthermore, we employed explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methodologies to elucidate the relationship between features and model predictions.Results The findings demonstrated that LightGBM achieved an accuracy of 0.70 in predicting PFS for advanced GC/GEJC patients. Furthermore, an F1-score of 0.77 was attained for identifying patients with PFS durations shorter than 7.1 months. Through the feature selection process, we identified 11 predictive features. Additionally, our framework facilitated the discovery of relationships between laboratory features and PFS.Conclusion A ML-based framework was developed to predict Sintilimab plus chemotherapy response duration with high accuracy. The suggested predictive features are easily accessible through routine laboratory tests. Furthermore, XAI techniques offer comprehensive explanations, both at the global and individual level, regarding PFS predictions. This framework enables patients to better understand their treatment plans, while clinicians can customize therapeutic approaches based on the explanations provided by the model."

The aim of this study was to investigate machine learning (ML) models using clinical data for predicting ER after microwave ablation (MWA). Methods: Between August 2005 and December 2019, 1574 patients with early-stage HCC underwent MWA at four hospitals were reviewed. Then, 36 clinical data points per patient were collected, and the patients were assigned to the training, internal, and external validation set. Apart from traditional logistic regression (LR), three ML models-random forest, support vector machine, and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)-were built and validated for their predictive ability with the area under ROC curve (AUC). Algorithms such as SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME) were used to realize their interpretability. Results: The three ML models all outperformed LR (P < 0.001 for all) in predictive ability. When nine variables (tumor number, platelet, alpha-fetoprotein, comorbidity score, white blood cell, cholinesterase, prothrombin time, neutrophils, and etiology) were extracted simultaneously using recursive feature elimination with cross-validation, the XGBoost model achieved the best discrimination among all models, with an AUC value 0.75 (95% CI [confidence interval]: 0.72-0.78) in the training set, 0.74 (95% CI: 0.69-0.80) in the internal validation set, and 0.76 (95% CI: 0.70-0.82) in the external validation set, and it was interpreted depending on the visualization of risk factors by the SHAP and LIME algorithms. The predictive system of post-ablation recurrence risk stratification was provided on online (http://114.251.235.51:8001/) based on XGboost analysis. Conclusion: The XGBoost model based on clinical data can effectively predict ER risk after MWA, which can contribute to surveillance, prevention, and treatment strategies for HCC."

Therefore, this study compared performance indices and permutation importance of potential confounders in three models for predicting 5-year recurrence after hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) resection: a deep-learning deep neural network (DNN) model, a recurrent neural network (RNN) model, and a Cox proportional hazard (CPH) regression model. Data for 725 patients who had received HCC resection at three medical centers in southern Taiwan between April, 2011, and December, 2015, were randomly divided into three datasets: a training dataset containing data for 507 subjects was used for model development, a testing dataset containing data for 109 subjects was used for internal validation, and a validating dataset containing data for 109 subjects was used for external validation. Feature importance analysis was also performed to identify potential predictors of recurrence after HCC resection. Univariate Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were performed to identify potential significant predictors of 5-year recurrence after HCC resection, which were included in the forecasting models (P < 0.05). All performance indices for the DNN model were significantly higher than those for the RNN model and the conventional CPH model (P < 0.001). The most important potential predictor of 5-year recurrence after HCC resection was surgeon volume followed by, in order of importance, hospital volume, preoperative Beck Depression Scale score, preoperative Beck Anxiety Scale score, co-residence with family, tumor stage, and tumor size. The feature importance analysis performed to investigate interpretability in this study elucidated the potential use of deep learning models for predicting recurrence after HCC resection and for identifying predictors of recurrence. Further experiments using the proposed DNN model would clarify its potential uses for developing, promoting, and improving health policies for treating HCC patients after surgery."

Comparing deep learning and concept extraction based methods for patient phenotyping from clinical narratives	PLOS ONE			English	Article							ELECTRONIC MEDICAL-RECORDS; INFORMATION; IDENTIFICATION; DISEASE; SYSTEM; CANCER; CLASSIFICATION; NORMALIZATION; ALGORITHMS; DISCOVERY	"In secondary analysis of electronic health records, a crucial task consists in correctly identifying the patient cohort under investigation. In many cases, the most valuable and relevant information for an accurate classification of medical conditions exist only in clinical narratives. Therefore, it is necessary to use natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract and evaluate these narratives. The most commonly used approach to this problem relies on extracting a number of clinician-defined medical concepts from text and using machine learning techniques to identify whether a particular patient has a certain condition. However, recent advances in deep learning and NLP enable models to learn a rich representation of (medical) language. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) for text classification can augment the existing techniques by leveraging the representation of language to learn which phrases in a text are relevant for a given medical condition. In this work, we compare concept extraction based methods with CNNs and other commonly used models in NLP in ten phenotyping tasks using 1,610 discharge summaries from the MIMIC-III database. We show that CNNs outperform concept extraction based methods in almost all of the tasks, with an improvement in F1-score of up to 26 and up to 7 percentage points in area under the ROC curve (AUC). We additionally assess the interpretability of both approaches by presenting and evaluating methods that calculate and extract the most salient phrases for a prediction. The results indicate that CNNs are a valid alternative to existing approaches in patient phenotyping and cohort identification, and should be further investigated. Moreover, the deep learning approach presented in this paper can be used to assist clinicians during chart review or support the extraction of billing codes from text by identifying and highlighting relevant phrases for various medical conditions."

Joint patient selection and scheduling under no-shows: Theory and application in proton therapy	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						appointment scheduling; index rules; no-shows; nonmonotone submodular maximization	HEALTH-CARE; SERVICE; APPROXIMATION; OPTIMIZATION; TRIAGE	"We study how to admit and schedule heterogeneous patients by using simple, interpretable, yet effective policies when capacity is scarce, no-show behavior is patient- and time-dependent, service duration and reward are deterministic but patient-dependent, and overtime is costly. Our work is motivated by the aforementioned operational challenges that typically face adopters of new technologies in the healthcare sector. We anchor our study on a partnership with the proton therapy center of Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), which offers a new radiation technology for cancer patients. We formulate the problem as a nonlinear integer optimization problem. However, as the solution to this formulation lacks both tractability and interpretability, to be relevant to practice, we limit our study to simple and interpretable policies. In particular, we propose a simple index-based rule and derive analytical performance guarantees for it. We also calibrate our model using empirical data from our partner hospital, and conduct a series of experiments to evaluate the performance of our proposed policy under practical circumstances. The analytical performance guarantees and our numerical experiments demonstrate (a) the strong performance of the proposed policies, and (b) their robustness to various practical considerations (e.g., to potential misspecification of no-show probabilities). Our results show that our proposed policy, despite being a simple and interpretable index-based rule, is capable of improving performance by about 20% at an organization such as MGH, and of delivering results that are not far from being optimal across a wide range of parameters that might vary between organizations. This suggests that the proposed policy can be viewed as an effective one-fits-all capacity allocation rule that can be used in a variety of environments in which operational challenges such as no-shows and overtime costs need to be navigated using simple and interpretable rules."

Its high economic profits in the market lead to the frequent occurrence of adulterating this oil with cheaper edible oils such as grape seed oil, walnut oil. It is difficult to detect adulteration as the oil adulterant has similar physical characteristic and even similar chemical composition to the authentic oil. The development of an accurate and rapid analytical method using attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy is of essential importance for determination of authenticity of BCSO and quantification of oil adulterants. In this study, BCSO and grape seed oil (GSO) were mixed in various ratios to mimic the adulteration. A clustering group lasso method was developed by incorporating both the high correlation structure of spectral variables and the underlying group features into the model. Instead of assuming that groups are known a priori as does ordinary group lasso, the clustering group lasso infers groups of spectral features from the data and encourages spectral variables within a group to have a shared association with the response. The model using ATRFTIR spectroscopy proved to be a powerful tool to quantify BCSO adulteration with high accuracy and can accurately predict the quantity of adulterant at levels as low as 5%. With a substantial reduction in number of spectral features, the clustering group lasso model shows a simple regression coefficient profile with improved interpretability as compared to the ordinary group lasso model and other penalized models. The spectral regions automatically selected for quantification of BCSO adulteration can be helpful for the interpretation of the major chemical constituents of BCSO regarding its anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory effects from a chemometric perspective."

However, in a high-dimensional background, this method may lead to overfitting, mainly due to the noise caused by considering irrelevant regressors. Hence, to reduce this side effect and increase the robustness and interpretability of the solution, the challenge is not only to combine the features but also to select them, obtaining a sparse result. There are several methods to perform feature selection. One of the most performing solution is to adopt regularization techniques. We propose the Penalized Youden Index Estimator (PYE), a method based on the Youden index and various penalization terms, capable of searching for the best selection and combination of biomarkers at the same time, maximizing this index. Depending on the considered regularization term, L 1 , L1, Elastic Net, SCAD, 2 and MCP, we propose different versions of PYE. Being the objective function possibly non-convex, we also propose a modified accelerated proximal gradient algorithm to optimize PYE. To test the effectiveness of our approach, a wide simulation study on synthetic and real high-dimensional datasets is presented, comparing the performance of our proposal with some of the most popular existing methods. The results show how PYE, in its different versions, returns alternative solutions with respect to the considered existing methods. In some cases more sparse, in others with a preferable balance among accuracy, selection, and which biomarkers have been considered relevant."

Understanding and studying patient adherence often involves interplay among many factors that influence whether a patient successfully follows recommendations or completes a therapy program. Functional frameworks serve to arrange these factors visually, increasing interpretability and allowing for empirical testing of relationships among concepts. The purpose of this article is to integrate relevant factors from the literature into a comprehensive framework that describes adherence to dysphagia treatment. Method: Using peer-reviewed, published guidelines regarding conceptual model construction, the authors created a list of potential factors that influence patient adherence to dysphagia-related treatment recommendations. During model construction, following extensive review of the literature and existing theories that have been applied in other areas of health care, factors were identified and grouped into conceptually similar domains (clusters). Clusters were arranged into larger categories that emerged during model optimization. Ultimately, two models were created: one that illustrates the interrelated factors of patient adherence and another that illustrates a subset of modifiable risk factors that a clinical speech-language pathologist may influence when developing a dysphagia treatment plan. Results: Three general categories from 14 factors emerged based on relationships between factors and aspects of patient care: health factors, individual patient factors, and contextual factors. A second model consisting of modifiable risk factors included access, treatment type, patient perceptions, self-efficacy, health literacy, support factors, and provider bias. Conclusions: This conceptual model allows clinicians and researchers to identify and explore the mechanisms driving adherence.

In recent years, numerous decision support systems have been developed to deal with smoking cessation based on machine learning methods. However, the inevitable class imbalance is considered a major challenge in deploying such systems. In this paper, we study an empirical comparison of machine learning techniques to deal with the class imbalance problem in the prediction of smoking cessation intervention among the Korean population. For the class imbalance problem, the objective of this paper is to improve the prediction performance based on the utilization of synthetic oversampling techniques, which we called the synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) and an adaptive synthetic (ADASYN). This has been achieved by the experimental design, which comprises three components. First, the selection of the best representative features is performed in two phases: the lasso method and multicollinearity analysis. Second, generate the newly balanced data utilizing SMOTE and ADASYN technique. Third, machine learning classifiers are applied to construct the prediction models among all subjects and each gender. In order to justify the effectiveness of the prediction models, the f-score, type I error, type II error, balanced accuracy and geometric mean indices are used. Comprehensive analysis demonstrates that Gradient Boosting Trees (GBT), Random Forest (RF) and multilayer perceptron neural network (MLP) classifiers achieved the best performances in all subjects and each gender when SMOTE and ADASYN were utilized. The SMOTE with GBT and RF models also provide feature importance scores that enhance the interpretability of the decision-support system. In addition, it is proven that the presented synthetic oversampling techniques with machine learning models outperformed baseline models in smoking cessation prediction."

Learning the relationship between bags and instances is challenging because of the unknown and possibly complicated data generating mechanism regarding how instances contribute to the bag label. MIL has been applied to solve a variety of real -world problems, which have been mostly focused on supervised tasks, such as molecule activity prediction, protein binding affinities prediction, object detection, and computer -aided diagnosis. However, to date, the majority of the off -the -shelf MIL methods are developed in the computer science domain, and they focus on improving the prediction performance while spending little effort on explainability of the algorithm. In this article a Bayesian multiple instance learning model, based on probit regression (MICProB), is proposed, which contributes a significant portion to the suite of statistical methodologies for MIL. MICProB is composed of two nested probit regression models, where the inner model is estimated for predicting primary instances, which are considered as the important ones that determine the bag label, and the outer model is for predicting bag -level responses based on the primary instances estimated by the inner model. The posterior distribution of MICProB can be conveniently approximated using a Gibbs sampler, and the prediction for new bags can be performed in a fully integrated Bayesian way. We evaluate the performance of MICProB against 15 benchmark methods and demonstrate its competitiveness in simulation and real -data examples. In addition to its capability of identifying primary instances, as compared to existing optimization -based approaches, MICProB also enjoys great advantages in providing a transparent model structure, straightforward statistical inference of quantities related to model parameters, and favorable interpretability of covariate effects on the bag -level response."

The aim of this study was to develop evolutionary learning-derived prediction models with interpretability using both clinical and radiomic features to predict early recurrence of HCC after surgical resection. Methods: Consecutive 517 HCC patients receiving surgical resection with available contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) images before resection were retrospectively enrolled. Patients were randomly assigned to a training set (n = 362) and a test set (n = 155) in a ratio of 7:3. Tumor segmentation of all CECT images including noncontrast phase, arterial phase, and portal venous phase was manually performed for radiomic feature extraction. A novel evolutionary learning-derived method called genetic algorithm for predicting recurrence after surgery of liver cancer (GARSL) was proposed to design prediction models for early recurrence of HCC within 2 years after surgery. Results: A total of 143 features, including 26 preoperative clinical features, 5 postoperative pathological features, and 112 radiomic features were used to develop GARSL preoperative and postoperative models. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) for early recurrence of HCC within 2 years were 0.781 and 0.767, respectively, in the training set, and 0.739 and 0.741, respectively, in the test set. The accuracy of GARSL models derived from the evolutionary learning method was significantly better than models derived from other well-known machine learning methods or the early recurrence after surgery for liver tumor (ERASL) preoperative (AUC = 0.687, p < 0.001 vs. GARSL preoperative) and ERASL postoperative (AUC = 0.688, p < 0.001 vs. GARSL postoperative) models using clinical features only. Conclusion: The GARSL models using both clinical and radiomic features significantly improved the accuracy to predict early recurrence of HCC after surgical resection, which was significantly better than other well-known machine learning-derived models and currently available clinical models."

It is usually several orders more intense than Raman scattering and hampers further analysis. In cases where the fluorescence emission is too intense to be efficiently removed via routine mathematical baseline correction algorithms, an alternative approach is needed. One alternative approach is shifted-excitation Raman difference spectroscopy (SERDS), where two Raman spectra are recorded with two slightly different excitation wavelengths. Ideally, the fluorescence emission at the two excitations does not change while the Raman spectrum shifts according to the excitation wavelength. Hence the fluorescence is removed in the difference of the two recorded Raman spectra. For better interpretability a spectral reconstruction procedure is necessary to recover the fluorescence-free Raman spectrum. This is challenging due to the intensity variations between the two recorded Raman spectra caused by unavoidable experimental changes as well as the presence of noise. Existent approaches suffer from drawbacks like spectral resolution loss, fluorescence residual, and artefacts. In this contribution, we proposed a reconstruction method based on non-negative least squares (NNLS), where the intensity variations between the two measurements are utilized in the reconstruction model. The method achieved fluorescence-free reconstruction on three real-world SERDS datasets without significant information loss. Thereafter, we quantified the performance of the reconstruction based on artificial datasets from four aspects: reconstructed spectral resolution, precision of reconstruction, signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR), and fluorescence residual. The artificial datasets were constructed with varied Raman to fluorescence intensity ratio (RFIR), SNR, full-width at half-maximum (FWHM), excitation wavelength shift, and fluorescence variation between the two spectra. It was demonstrated that the NNLS approach provides a faithful reconstruction without significantly changing the spectral resolution. Meanwhile, the reconstruction is almost robust to fluorescence variations between the two spectra. Last but not the least the SNR was improved after reconstruction for extremely noisy SERDS datasets."

This study aimed to develop and validate prognostic models for predicting the survival probability in newly diagnosed lower-grade glioma (LGG) patients. METHODS Detailed data were obtained for newly diagnosed LGG from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA) cohorts. Survival was assessed using Cox proportional hazards regression with adjustment for known prognostic factors. The model was established using the TCGA cohort, and independently validated using the CGGA cohort, to predict the 3-, 5-, and 10-year survival probabilities of patients. RESULTS Data from 293 patients with newly diagnosed LGG from the TCGA cohort were used to establish a prognostic model, and from 232 patients with primary LGG in the CGGA cohort to validate the model. Age, tumor grade, molecular subtype, tumor resection, and preoperative neurological deficits were included in the prediction model. The Cox regression model had a satisfactory corrected concordance index of 0.8508, 0.8510, and 0.8516 in the internal bootstrap validation at 3, 5, and 10 years, respectively. The calibration plots demonstrated high consistency of the predicted and observed outcomes. The CGGA cohort was used for external validation and showed satisfactory discrimination of 0.7776, 0.7682, and 0.7051 at 3, 5, and 10 years, respectively. The calibration plots demonstrated an acceptable calibration capability in the external validation. CONCLUSIONS This study established and validated a prognostic model to predict the survival probability of patients with newly diagnosed LGG.

Use of fast-sequence spine MRI in pediatric patients	JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY-PEDIATRICS			English	Article						MRI; fast sequence; spine; sedation	PROTOCOL; HYDROCEPHALUS; CANCER	"OBJECTIVE The immediate and long-term risk of anesthesia in the pediatric population is controversial. Traditional spine MRI protocols require the patient to remain still during the examination, and in young children this frequently results in the need for sedation administration. The authors' goal was to develop an abbreviated spine MRI protocol to reduce sedation administration in young patients undergoing spine MRI. METHODS After IRB approval, the medical records of all pediatric patients who underwent a fast spine MRI protocol between 2017 and 2019 were reviewed. The protocol consisted of T2-weighted half-Fourier acquisition single-shot turbo spin echo, T1-weighted turbo spin echo, and T2-weighted STIR sequences acquired in the sagittal plane. The total acquisition time was 2 minutes with no single sequence acquisition longer than 60 seconds. Interpretability of the scans was assessed in accordance with the radiology report in conjunction with the neurosurgeon's clinical notes. RESULTS A total of 47 fast spine MRI sessions were performed in 45 patients. The median age at the time of the MRI was 2.4 years (25th-75th quartile, 1.1-4.3 years; range 0.16-18.58 years). The most common indication for imaging was to rule out or follow a known syrinx (n = 30), followed by the need to rule out or follow known spinal dysraphism (n = 22). There were no uninterpretable or unusable scans. Eight of 47 scans were noted to have moderate motion artifact limitations with respect to the quality of the scan. Seven patients underwent a subsequent MRI with a sedated standard spine protocol within 1 year from the fast scan, which confirmed the findings on the fast MRI protocol with no new findings identified. CONCLUSIONS The authors report the first pediatric series of a fast spine MRI protocol for use in young patients. The protocol does not require sedation and is able to identify and monitor syrinx, spinal dysraphism, and potentially other intraspinal anomalies."

Data from multiple hospitals were collected, and 10 key features were selected from 1600 3D radiomic signatures and 11 radiological features. Diverse decision rules were extracted using ensemble learning methods (gradient boosting, random forest, and AdaBoost), fused, ranked, and selected via RuleFit and SHAP to construct a rule-based diagnostic model. The model's performance was evaluated using AUC, precision, accuracy, recall, and F1-score and compared with other models. The rule-based diagnostic model exhibited excellent performance in the training, testing, and validation cohorts, with AUC values of 0.9621, 0.9529, and 0.8953, respectively. This model outperformed counterparts relying solely on selected features and previous research models. Specifically, the AUC values for the previous research models in the three cohorts were 0.851, 0.893, and 0.836. It is noteworthy that individual models employing GBDT, random forest, and AdaBoost demonstrated AUC values of 0.9391, 0.8681, and 0.9449 in the training cohort, 0.9093, 0.8722, and 0.9363 in the testing cohort, and 0.8440, 0.8640, and 0.8750 in the validation cohort, respectively. These results highlight the superiority of the rule-based diagnostic model in the assessment of lung adenocarcinoma subtypes, while also providing insights into the performance of individual models. Integrating diverse decision rules enhanced the accuracy and interpretability of the diagnostic model for lung adenocarcinoma subtypes. This approach bridges the gap between complex predictive models and clinical utility, offering valuable support to healthcare professionals and patients."

The methodological quality of the studies was assessed using the Consensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement Instruments (COSMIN) checklist. Measurement property results were assessed using the adapted criteria. Each measurement property was allocated a separate rating (excellent, good, fair, or poor). Modified Letter Turned CommaBest evidence synthesis' was performed using COSMIN outcomes and the quality of findings.Result:Two hundred and nine publications were included, and 18 instruments were identified. ECOG, EuroQol-5D, SF-36, SOSGOQ, and EORTC-QLQ-C30 were the top five instruments used for patients with SM in published literature. The measurement properties evaluated included internal consistency (four instruments), reliability (three instruments), validity (five instruments), validity (nine measures), floor and ceiling effects (four instruments), responsiveness (four instruments), and interpretability (three measures). Based on the limited evidence, the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) had the best methodological quality.Conclusions:Owing to the limitations of BPI in assessment domains, we cannot fully support the use of BPI. For the lack of high-quality research, it is challenging to nominate a single appropriate measure. Additional studies are needed to explore the evidence before a confirmatory decision is made."

The purpose of this study was to assess radiomics versus dual-energy CT (DECT) material decomposition to objectively distinguish visually unequivocal abdominal lymphoma and benign lymph nodes.MethodsRetrospectively, 72 patients [m, 47; age, 63.5 (27-87) years] with nodal lymphoma (n = 27) or benign abdominal lymph nodes (n = 45) who had contrast-enhanced abdominal DECT between 06/2015 and 07/2019 were included. Three lymph nodes per patient were manually segmented to extract radiomics features and DECT material decomposition values. We used intra-class correlation analysis, Pearson correlation and LASSO to stratify a robust and non-redundant feature subset. Independent train and test data were applied on a pool of four machine learning models. Performance and permutation-based feature importance was assessed to increase the interpretability and allow for comparison of the models. Top performing models were compared by the DeLong test.ResultsAbout 38% (19/50) and 36% (8/22) of the train and test set patients had abdominal lymphoma. Clearer entity clusters were seen in t-SNE plots using a combination of DECT and radiomics features compared to DECT features only. Top model performances of AUC = 0.763 (CI = 0.435-0.923) were achieved for the DECT cohort and AUC = 1.000 (CI = 1.000-1.000) for the radiomics feature cohort to stratify visually unequivocal lymphomatous lymph nodes. The performance of the radiomics model was significantly (p = 0.011, DeLong) superior to the DECT model.ConclusionsRadiomics may have the potential to objectively stratify visually unequivocal nodal lymphoma versus benign lymph nodes. Radiomics seems superior to spectral DECT material decomposition in this use case. Therefore, artificial intelligence methodologies may not be restricted to centers with DECT equipment."

These processes and factors are not wholly assessed, while assessment of these factors is an essential need for getting a transparent and evidence-based approach toward medicine reimbursement in Iran. This paper aims to show an evidence-based approach toward medicine selection criteria to inform the medical reimbursement decision makers in Iranian health insurance organizations. To explore an adaptable decision-making framework while incorporating a method called Borda in medicine reimbursement assessment, we used the help of an expert group including decision makers and clinical researchers who are also policy makers to appraise the five chief criteria that have three sub criteria (Precision, Interpretability, and Cost). Also software Math-lab 7, SPSS 17 and Excel 2007 were used in this study. Borda estimates the amount of perceived values from different criteria and creates a range from one to five while providing a comprehensive measurement of a large spectrum of criteria. Participants reported that the framework provided an efficient approach to systematic consideration in a pragmatic format consisting of many parts to guide decision-makings, including criteria and value (a model with the core of Borda) and evidences (medicine reimbursement based on criteria). The most important criterion for medicine acceptance in health insurance companies, in Iran, is the life-threatening factor and evidence quality is accounted as the fifth important factor. This pilot study showed the usefulness of incorporating Borda in medicine reimbursement decisions to support a transparent and systematic appraisal of health insurance companies' deeds. Further research is needed to advance Borda-based approaches that are effective on health insurance decision making."

It is currently feasible to generate omic-scale biological measurements for all patients in a study, providing an opportunity for machine learning models to identify molecular markers for disease diagnosis and progression. However, the high variability of genetic background in human populations hampers the reproducibility of omic-scale markers. In this paper, we develop a biological network-based regularized artificial neural network model for prediction of phenotype from transcriptomic measurements in clinical trials. To improve model sparsity and the overall reproducibility of the model, we incorporate regularization for simultaneous shrinkage of gene sets based on active upstream regulatory mechanisms into the model. Results: We benchmark our method against various regression, support vector machines and artificial neural network models and demonstrate the ability of our method in predicting the clinical outcomes using clinical trial data on acute rejection in kidney transplantation and response to Infliximab in ulcerative colitis. We show that integration of prior biological knowledge into the classification as developed in this paper, significantly improves the robustness and generalizability of predictions to independent datasets. We provide a Java code of our algorithm along with a parsed version of the STRING DB database. Conclusion: In summary, we present a method for prediction of clinical phenotypes using baseline genome-wide expression data that makes use of prior biological knowledge on gene-regulatory interactions in order to increase robustness and reproducibility of omic-scale markers.

Quantifying uncertainty in machine learning classifiers for medical imaging	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER ASSISTED RADIOLOGY AND SURGERY			English	Article						Uncertainty; Medical imaging; Neural network; Confidence		"Purpose Machine learning (ML) models in medical imaging (MI) can be of great value in computer aided diagnostic systems, but little attention is given to the confidence (alternatively, uncertainty) of such models, which may have significant clinical implications. This paper applied, validated, and explored a technique for assessing uncertainty in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in the context of MI. Materials and methods We used two publicly accessible imaging datasets: a chest x-ray dataset (pneumonia vs. control) and a skin cancer imaging dataset (malignant vs. benign) to explore the proposed measure of uncertainty based on experiments with different class imbalance-sample sizes, and experiments with images close to the classification boundary. We also further verified our hypothesis by examining the relationship with other performance metrics and cross-checking CNN predictions and confidence scores with an expert radiologist (available in the Supplementary Information). Additionally, bounds were derived on the uncertainty metric, and recommendations for interpretability were made. Results With respect to training set class imbalance for the pneumonia MI dataset, the uncertainty metric was minimized when both classes were nearly equal in size (regardless of training set size) and was approximately 17% smaller than the maximum uncertainty resulting from greater imbalance. We found that less-obvious test images (those closer to the classification boundary) produced higher classification uncertainty, about 10-15 times greater than images further from the boundary. Relevant MI performance metrics like accuracy, sensitivity, and sensibility showed seemingly negative linear correlations, though none were statistically significant (p >= 0.05). The expert radiologist and CNN expressed agreement on a small sample of test images, though this finding is only preliminary. Conclusions This paper demonstrated the importance of uncertainty reporting alongside predictions in medical imaging. Results demonstrate considerable potential from automatically assessing classifier reliability on each prediction with the proposed uncertainty metric."

This systematic review examines the performance of machine learning (ML) algorithms and evaluates the progress made to date towards their implementation in clinical practice.Methods: Systematic searching of databases (PubMed, MEDLINE, Scopus, Google Scholar, Cochrane Library and WHO Covid-19 database) to identify original articles published between January 2011 and October 2021. Studies reporting ML techniques in clinical practice involving humans and ML algorithms with a performance metric were considered.Results: Of 873 unique articles identified, 36 studies were eligible for inclusion. The XGBoost (extreme gradient boosting) algorithm showed the highest potential for clinical applications (n = 7 studies); this was followed jointly by random forest algorithm, logistic regression, and the support vector machine, respectively (n = 5 studies). Prediction of outcomes (n = 33), in particular Inflammatory diseases (n = 7) received the most attention followed by cancer and neuropsychiatric disorders (n = 5 for each) and Covid-19 (n = 4). Thirty-three out of the thirty-six included studies passed more than 50% of the selected quality assessment criteria in the TRIPOD checklist. In contrast, none of the studies could achieve an ideal overall bias rating of 'low' based on the PROBAST checklist. In contrast, only three studies showed evidence of the deployment of ML algorithm(s) in clinical practice.Conclusions: ML is potentially a reliable tool for clinical decision support. Although advocated widely in clinical practice, work is still in progress to validate clinically adapted ML algorithms. Improving quality standards, transparency, and interpretability of ML models will further lower the barriers to acceptability."

Understanding the decisions of CNNs: An in-model approach	PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS			English	Article						Explainable AI; Explainability; Interpretability; Deep Llearning; Convolutional Nneural Nnetworks		"With the outstanding predictive performance of Convolutional Neural Networks on different tasks and their widespread use in real-world scenarios, it is essential to understand and trust these black-box models. While most of the literature focuses on post-model methods, we propose a novel in-model joint architecture, composed by an explainer and a classifier. This architecture outputs not only a class label, but also a visual explanation of such decision, without the need for additional labelled data to train the explainer besides the image class. The model is trained end-to-end, with the classifier taking as input an image and the explainer's resulting explanation, thus allowing for the classifier to focus on the relevant areas of such explanation. Moreover, this approach can be employed with any classifier, provided that the necessary connections to the explainer are made. We also propose a three-phase training process and two alternative custom loss functions that regularise the produced explanations and encourage desired properties, such as sparsity and spatial contiguity. The architecture was validated in two datasets (a subset of ImageNet and a cervical cancer dataset) and the obtained results show that it is able to produce meaningful image- and class-dependent visual explanations, without direct supervision, aligned with intuitive visual features associated with the data. Quantitative assessment of explanation quality was conducted through iterative perturbation of the input image according to the explanation heatmaps. The impact on classification performance is studied in terms of average function value and AOPC (Area Over the MoRF (Most Relevant First) Curve). For further evaluation, we propose POMPOM (Percentage of Meaningful Pixels Outside the Mask) as another measurable criteria of explanation goodness. These analyses showed that the proposed method outperformed state-of-the-art post-model methods, such as LRP (Layer-wise Relevance Propagation). (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

This paper proposes a multimodal method for differentiating various clinical forms of basal cell carcinoma and benign neoplasms that includes machine learning. This study was conducted on 37 neoplasms, including benign neoplasms and five different clinical forms of basal cell carcinoma. The proposed multimodal screening method combines diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, optical coherence tomography and high-frequency ultrasound. Using diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, the coefficients of melanin pigmentation, erythema, hemoglobin content, and the slope coefficient of diffuse reflectance spectroscopy in the wavelength range 650-800 nm were determined. Statistical texture analysis of optical coherence tomography images was used to calculate first- and second-order statistical parameters. The analysis of ultrasound images assessed the shape of the tumor according to parameters such as area, perimeter, roundness and other characteristics. Based on the calculated parameters, a machine learning algorithm was developed to differentiate the various clinical forms of basal cell carcinoma. The proposed algorithm for classifying various forms of basal cell carcinoma and benign neoplasms provided a sensitivity of 70.6 +/- 17.3%, specificity of 95.9 +/- 2.5%, precision of 72.6 +/- 14.2%, F1 score of 71.5 +/- 15.6% and mean intersection over union of 57.6 +/- 20.1%. Moreover, for differentiating basal cell carcinoma and benign neoplasms without taking into account the clinical form, the method achieved a sensitivity of 89.1 +/- 8.0%, specificity of 95.1 +/- 0.7%, F1 score of 89.3 +/- 3.4% and mean intersection over union of 82.6 +/- 10.8%."

Clustering is a fundamental task in this analysis to disclose the transcriptomic profiles of single cells and is one of the key computational problems that has received widespread attention. Recently, many clustering algorithms have been developed for the scRNA-seq data. Nevertheless, the computational models often suffer from realistic restrictions such as numerical instability, high dimensionality and computational scalability. Moreover, the accumulating cell numbers and high dropout rates bring a huge computational challenge to the analysis. To address these limitations, we first provide a systematic and extensive performance evaluation of four feature selection methods and nine scRNA-seq clustering algorithms on fourteen real single-cell RNA-seq datasets. Based on this, we then propose an accurate single-cell data analysis via Ensemble Feature Selection based Clustering, called scEFSC. Indeed, the algorithm employs several unsupervised feature selections to remove genes that do not contribute significantly to the scRNA-seq data. After that, different single-cell RNA-seq clustering algorithms are proposed to cluster the data filtered by multiple unsupervised feature selections, and then the clustering results are combined using weighted-based meta-clustering. We applied scEFSC to the fourteen real single-cell RNAseq datasets and the experimental results demonstrated that our proposed scEFSC outperformed the other scRNA-seq clustering algorithms with several evaluation metrics. In addition, we established the biological interpretability of scEFSC by carrying out differential gene expression analysis, gene ontology enrichment and KEGG analysis. scEFSC is available at https://github.com/Conan-Bian/scEFSC.

Despite extensive growth in the area of radiogenomics across many cancers, and its potential role in advancing clinical decision making, no published studies have directly addressed uncertainty in these model predictions. We developed a radiogenomics ML model to quantify uncertainty using transductive Gaussian Processes (GP) and a unique dataset of 95 image-localized biopsies with spatially matched MRI from 25 untreated Glioblastoma (GBM) patients. The model generated predictions for regional EGFR amplification status (a common and important target in GBM) to resolve the intratumoral genetic heterogeneity across each individual tumor-a key factor for future personalized therapeutic paradigms. The model used probability distributions for each sample prediction to quantify uncertainty, and used transductive learning to reduce the overall uncertainty. We compared predictive accuracy and uncertainty of the transductive learning GP model against a standard GP model using leave-one-patient-out cross validation. Additionally, we used a separate dataset containing 24 image-localized biopsies from 7 high-grade glioma patients to validate the model. Predictive uncertainty informed the likelihood of achieving an accurate sample prediction. When stratifying predictions based on uncertainty, we observed substantially higher performance in the group cohort (75% accuracy, n=95) and amongst sample predictions with the lowest uncertainty (83% accuracy, n=72) compared to predictions with higher uncertainty (48% accuracy, n=23), due largely to data interpolation (rather than extrapolation). On the separate validation set, our model achieved 78% accuracy amongst the sample predictions with lowest uncertainty.

This study used bibliometrics to analyze the research trends and current status of this field over the past almost 23 years and explored possible future research hotspots. Methods: We searched the Web of Science (WOS) literature on RADSs from January 1, 2000, to November 1, 2022, and evaluated the findings visually with VOSviewer (1.6.18), CiteSpace (6.1.3), and the bibliometrix package in R version 4.2.1. Results: We included 6,239 publications from 88 countries and regions. The number of published has shown an overall growth trend, especially since 2016. The United States was the country with the highest number of publications and citations. The top 10 most productive institutions in RADS research were mainly from South Korea and the United States. Kim EK was the most published author, and Turkbey B had the most cited publication. European Radiology had the most publications on the subject, while Radiology was the most influential journal. Magnetic resonance imaging, carcinoma, ultrasound, RADS, mammography, breast neoplasms , and diagnosis were the most common keywords. Artificial intelligence (AI) appears to be an emerging hotspot in the research of RADS. Conclusions: This study provides an overview of the development status of research into RADSs over the past 23 years. Research into RADSs has included various systems of the body, with the most studied being the breast, prostate, liver, and thyroid. In terms of auxiliary diagnosis, there is an increasing amount of research into the application of AI in RADSs, which along with the interpretability of AI, will be a hotspot of research in the following years."

Existing computer-aided methods for predicting WSI are mainly based on multiple instance learning (MIL) and its variants. However, most of the methods are based on instance independence and identical distribution assumption and performed at a single scale, which not fully exploit the hierarchical multiscale heterogeneous information contained in WSI. Methods: Heterogeneous Subgraph-Guided Multiscale Graph Attention Fusion Network (HSG-MGAF Net) is proposed to build the topology of critical image patches at two scales for adaptive WSI prediction and lesion localization. The HSG-MGAF Net simulates the hierarchical heterogeneous information of WSI through graph and hypergraph at two scales, respectively. This framework not only fully exploits the low-order and potential high-order correlations of image patches at each scale, but also leverages the heterogeneous information of the two scales for adaptive WSI prediction. Results: We validate the superiority of the proposed method on the CAMELYON16 and the TCGA- NSCLC, and the results show that HSG-MGAF Net outperforms the state-of-the-art method on both datasets. The average ACC, AUC and F1 score of HSG-MGAF Net can reach 92.7 %/0.951/0.892 and 92.2 %/0.957/0.919, respectively. The obtained heatmaps can also localize the positive regions more accurately, which have great consistency with the pixel-level labels. Conclusions: The results demonstrate that HSG-MGAF Net outperforms existing weakly supervised learning methods by introducing critical heterogeneous information between the two scales. This approach paves the way for further research on light weighted heterogeneous graph-based WSI prediction and ROI localization."

Particularly, atypical EH also known as endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia (EIN), has been proven to be a precursor of EC. Thus, diagnosing different EH (EIN, hyperplasia without atypia (HwA) and NE) and screening EIN from non-EIN are crucial for the health of female reproductive system. Computer-aided-diagnosis (CAD) was used to diagnose endometrial histological images based on machine learning and deep learning. However, these studies perform single-scale image analysis and thus can only characterize partial endometrial features. Empirically, both global (cytological changes relative to background) and local features (gland-to-stromal ratio and lesion dimension) are helpful in identifying endometrial lesions. Methods: We proposed a global-to-local multi-scale convolutional neural network (G2LNet) to diagnose different EH and to screen EIN in endometrial histological images stained by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). The G2LNet first used a supervised model in the global part to extract contextual features of endometrial lesions, and simultaneously deployed multi-instance learning in the local part to obtain textural features from multiple image patches. The contextual and textural features were used together to diagnose different endometrial lesions after fusion by a convolutional block attention module. In addition, we visualized the salient regions on both the global image and local images to investigate the interpretability of the model in endometrial diagnosis. Results: In the five-fold cross validation on 7812 H&E images from 467 endometrial specimens, G2LNet achieved an accuracy of 97.01% for EH diagnosis and an area-under-the-curve (AUC) of 0.9902 for EIN screening, significantly higher than state-of-the-arts. In external validation on 1631 H&E images from 135 specimens, G2LNet achieved an accuracy of 95.34% for EH diagnosis, which was comparable to that of a mid-level pathologist (95.71%). Specifically, G2LNet had advantages in diagnosing EIN, while humans performed better in identifying NE and HwA. Conclusions: The developed G2LNet that integrated both the global (contextual) and local (textural) features may help pathologists diagnose endometrial lesions in clinical practices, especially to improve the accuracy and efficiency of screening for precancerous lesions.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: Individual qualitative interviews were conducted in adults with NSCLC (Stages I IV) in the United States. Experienced interviewers conducted concept-elicitation (CE) and cognitive interviews using semistructured interview guides. The CE interview guide was used for eliciting spontaneous reports of symptom experiences along with probing to further explore and confirm concepts. Interview transcripts were coded and analyzed by professional qualitative coders, and were summarized by like content using an iterative coding framework. Data from the CE interviews were considered alongside existing literature and clinical expert opinion during an item-generation process, leading to the development of a preliminary version of the NSCLC Symptom Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ). Three waves of cognitive interviews were conducted to evaluate concept relevance, item interpretability, and structure of the draft items and to facilitate further instrument refinement. Findings: Fifty-one subjects (mean [SD] age, 64.9 [11.2] years; 51.0% women) participated in the CE interviews. A total of 1897 expressions of NSCLC-related symptoms were identified and coded in interview transcripts, representing 42 distinct symptom concepts. A 9-item initial-draft instrument was developed for testing in 3 waves of cognitive interviews with additional subjects with NSCLC (n = 20), during which both paper and electronic versions of the instrument were evaluated and refined. Participant responses and feedback during cognitive interviews led to the removal of 2 items and substantial modifications to others. Implications: The NSCLC-SAQ is a 7-item PRO measure intended for use in advanced NSCLC clinical trials to support medical product labelling. The NSCLC-SAQ uses a 7-day recall period and verbal rating scales. It was developed in accordance with the US Food and Drug Administration's PRO Guidance and scientific best practices, and the resulting qualitative interview data provide evidence of content validity. The NSCLC-SAQ has been prepared in both paper and electronic administration formats and a tablet computer based version is currently undergoing quantitative testing to confirm its measurement properties and support US Food and Drug Administration qualification.

Surgery followed by Stupp protocol still remains the first-line treatment in GG4 tumors. Although Stupp combination can prolong survival, prognosis of treated adult patients with GG4 still remains unfavorable. The introduction of innovative multi-parametric prognostic models may allow refinement of prognosis of these patients. Here, Machine Learning (ML) was applied to investigate the contribution in predicting overall survival (OS) of different available data (e.g. clinical data, radiological data, or panel-based sequencing data such as presence of somatic mutations and amplification) in a mono-institutional GG4 cohort.MethodsBy next-generation sequencing, using a panel of 523 genes, we performed analysis of copy number variations and of types and distribution of nonsynonymous mutations in 102 cases including 39 carmustine wafer (CW) treated cases. We also calculated tumor mutational burden (TMB). ML was applied using eXtreme Gradient Boosting for survival (XGBoost-Surv) to integrate clinical and radiological information with genomic data.ResultsBy ML modeling (concordance (c)- index = 0.682 for the best model), the role of predicting OS of radiological parameters including extent of resection, preoperative volume and residual volume was confirmed. An association between CW application and longer OS was also showed. Regarding gene mutations, a role in predicting OS was defined for mutations of BRAF and of other genes involved in the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway. Moreover, an association between high TMB and shorter OS was suggested. Consistently, when a cutoff of 1.7 mutations/megabase was applied, cases with higher TMB showed significantly shorter OS than cases with lower TMB.ConclusionsThe contribution of tumor volumetric data, somatic gene mutations and TBM in predicting OS of GG4 patients was defined by ML modeling."

CX-Net: an efficient ensemble semantic deep neural network for ROI identification from chest-x-ray images for COPD diagnosis	MACHINE LEARNING-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						chest x-ray; COPD; CX-Net; ensemble learning; SHAP and Grad-CAM; VinDR-chest x-ray	COMPUTER-AIDED DIAGNOSIS; LUNG-CANCER; SEGMENTATION; SHAPE; RECOGNITION; EMPHYSEMA	"Automatic identification of salient features in large medical datasets, particularly in chest x-ray (CXR) images, is a crucial research area. Accurately detecting critical findings such as emphysema, pneumothorax, and chronic bronchitis can aid radiologists in prioritizing time-sensitive cases and screening for abnormalities. However, traditional deep neural network approaches often require bounding box annotations, which can be time-consuming and challenging to obtain. This study proposes an explainable ensemble learning approach, CX-Net, for lung segmentation and diagnosing lung disorders using CXR images. We compare four state-of-the-art convolutional neural network models, including feature pyramid network, U-Net, LinkNet, and a customized U-Net model with ImageNet feature extraction, data augmentation, and dropout regularizations. All models are trained on the Montgomery and VinDR-CXR datasets with and without segmented ground-truth masks. To achieve model explainability, we integrate SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) techniques, which enable a better understanding of the decision-making process and provide visual explanations of critical regions within the CXR images. By employing ensembling, our outlier-resistant CX-Net achieves superior performance in lung segmentation, with Jaccard overlap similarity of 0.992, Dice coefficients of 0.994, precision of 0.993, recall of 0.980, and accuracy of 0.976. The proposed approach demonstrates strong generalization capabilities on the VinDr-CXR dataset and is the first study to use these datasets for semantic lung segmentation with semi-supervised localization. In conclusion, this paper presents an explainable ensemble learning approach for lung segmentation and diagnosing lung disorders using CXR images. Extensive experimental results show that our method efficiently and accurately extracts regions of interest in CXR images from publicly available datasets, indicating its potential for integration into clinical decision support systems. Furthermore, incorporating SHAP and Grad-CAM techniques further enhances the interpretability and trustworthiness of the AI-driven diagnostic system."

This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of the existing research on the utilization of machine learning and deep learning in the field of skin disease diagnosis, with a particular focus on recent widely used methods of deep learning. The present challenges and constraints were also analyzed and possible solutions were proposed. Methods: We collected comprehensive works from the literature, sourced from distinguished databases including IEEE, Springer, Web of Science, and PubMed, with a particular emphasis on the most recent 5-year advancements. From the extensive corpus of available research, twenty-nine articles relevant to the segmentation of dermatological images and forty-five articles about the classification of dermatological images were incorporated into this review. These articles were systematically categorized into two classes based on the computational algorithms utilized: traditional machine learning algorithms and deep learning algorithms. An in-depth comparative analysis was carried out, based on the employed methodologies and their corresponding outcomes. Conclusions: Present outcomes of research highlight the enhanced effectiveness of deep learning methods over traditional machine learning techniques in the field of dermatological diagnosis. Nevertheless, there remains significant scope for improvement, especially in improving the accuracy of algorithms. The challenges associated with the availability of diverse datasets, the generalizability of segmentation and classification models, and the interpretability of models also continue to be pressing issues. Moreover, the focus of future research should be appropriately shifted. A significant amount of existing research is primarily focused on melanoma, and consequently there is a need to broaden the field of pigmented dermatology research in the future. These insights not only emphasize the potential of deep learning in dermatological diagnosis but also highlight directions that should be focused on."

It is thus necessary to study the health effects of dietary exposure to chemical mixtures rather than single contaminants.We aimed to investigate the association between dietary exposure to chemical mixtures and mortality risk in the E3N French prospective cohort.We included 72,585 women from the E3N cohort who completed a food frequency questionnaire in 1993. From 197 chemicals, and using sparse non-negative matrix under-approximation (SNMU), we identified six main chemical mix-tures to which these women were chronically exposed through the diet. We estimated the associations between dietary exposure to these mixtures and all-cause or cause-specific mortality using Cox proportional hazard models. During the follow-up (1993-2014), 6441 deaths occurred. We observed no association between dietary exposure to three mixtures and all-cause mortality, and a non-monotonic inverse association for the three other mixtures.These results could be explained by the fact that, despite the different dietary adjustment strategies tested, we did not fully succeed in excluding the residual confounding from the overall effect of the diet. We also questioned the number of chemicals to include in mixtures' studies, as a balance needs to be reached between including a large number of chemicals and the interpretability of the results. Integrating a priori knowledge, such as toxicological data, could lead to the identification of more parsimonious mixtures, thus to more interpretable results. Moreover, as the SNMU is a non-supervised method, which identifies the mixtures only on the basis of the correlations between the exposure variables, and not in relation to the outcome, it would be interesting to test supervised methods. Finally, further studies are needed to identify the most adequate approach to investigate the health effects of dietary exposure to chemical mixtures in observational studies."

Alongside the recognition that the tumour microenvironment (TME) has a profound impact on tumour phenotype, the technical development of highly multiplexed immunofluorescence platforms has enhanced the biological complexity that can be captured in the TME with high precision. AI has an increasingly powerful role in the recognition and quantitation of image features and the association of such features with clinically important outcomes, as occurs in distinct stages in conventional machine learning. Deep-learning algorithms are able to elucidate TME patterns inherent in the input data with minimum levels of human intelligence and, hence, have the potential to achieve clinically relevant predictions and discovery of important TME features. Furthermore, the diverse repertoire of deep-learning algorithms able to interrogate TME patterns extends beyond convolutional neural networks to include attention-based models, graph neural networks, and multimodal models. To date, AI models have largely been evaluated retrospectively, outside the well-established rigour of prospective clinical trials, in part because traditional clinical trial methodology may not always be suitable for the assessment of AI technology. However, to enable digital pathology-based advanced analytics to meaningfully impact clinical care, specific measures of 'added benefit' to the current standard of care and validation in a prospective setting are important. This will need to be accompanied by adequate measures of explainability and interpretability. Despite such challenges, the combination of expanding datasets, increased computational power, and the possibility of integration of pre-clinical experimental insights into model development means there is exciting potential for the future progress of these AI applications. & COPY; 2023 The Authors.

The diagnosis of pathological section analysis suffers from diagnostic delay and cumbersome operating procedures. Therefore, we intend to construct the models based on spectral data that can be potentially used for rapid intraoperative papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) diagnosis and characterize PTC characteristics. To alleviate any concerns pathologists may have about using the model, we conducted an analysis of the used bands that can be interpreted pathologically. A spectra acquisition system was first built to acquire spectra of pathological section images from 91 patients. The obtained spectral dataset contains 217 spectra of normal thyroid tissue and 217 spectra of PTC tissue. Clinical data of the corresponding patients were collected for subsequent model interpretability analysis. The experiment has been approved by the Ethics Review Committee of the Wuhu Hospital of East China Normal University. The spectral preprocessing method was used to process the spectra, and the preprocessed signal respectively optimized by the first and secondary informative wavelengths selection was used to develop the PTC detection models. The PTC detection model using mean centering (MC) and multiple scattering correction (MSC) has optimal performance, and the reasons for the good performance were analyzed in combination with the spectral acquisition process and composition of the test slide. For model interpretable analysis, the near-ultraviolet band selected for modeling corresponds to the location of amino acid absorption peak, and this is consistent with the clinical phenomenon of significantly lower amino acid concentrations in PTC patients. Moreover, the absorption peak of hemoglobin selected for modeling is consistent with the low hemoglobin index in PTC patients. In addition, the correlation analysis was performed between the selected wavelengths and the clinical data, and the results show: the reflection intensity of selected wavelengths in normal cells has a moderate correlation with cell arrangement structure, nucleus size and free thyroxine (FT4), and has a strong correlation with triiodothyronine (T3); the reflection intensity of selected bands in PTC cells has a moderate correlation with free triiodothyronine (FT3)."

Biomarker discovery from high-dimensional data, such as transcriptomic or single nucleotide polymorphism profiles, is a major challenge in the search for more precise diagnoses. The proportional hazard regression model suggested by Cox (1972), to study the relationship between the time to event and a set of covariates in the presence of censoring is the most commonly used model for the analysis of survival data. However, like multivariate regression, it supposes that more observations than variables, complete data, and not strongly correlated variables are available. In practice, when dealing with high-dimensional data, these constraints are crippling. Collinearity gives rise to issues of over-fitting and model misidentification. Variable selection can improve the estimation accuracy by effectively identifying the subset of relevant predictors and enhance the model interpretability with parsimonious representation. To deal with both collinearity and variable selection issues, many methods based on least absolute shrinkage and selection operator penalized Cox proportional hazards have been proposed since the reference paper of Tibshirani. Regularization could also be performed using dimension reduction as is the case with partial least squares (PLS) regression. We propose two original algorithms named sPLSDR and its non-linear kernel counterpart DKsPLSDR, by using sparse PLS regression (sPLS) based on deviance residuals. We compared their predicting performance with state-of-the-art algorithms on both simulated and real reference benchmark datasets. Results: sPLSDR and DKsPLSDR compare favorably with other methods in their computational time, prediction and selectivity, as indicated by results based on benchmark datasets. Moreover, in the framework of PLS regression, they feature other useful tools, including biplots representation, or the ability to deal with missing data. Therefore, we view them as a useful addition to the toolbox of estimation and prediction methods for the widely used Cox's model in the high-dimensional and low-sample size settings."

We present a structured review of these methods organized by their degree of verifiability and by commonly recurring application areas in oncological characterization. First, we discuss morphological markers (tumor presence/absence, metastases, subtypes, grades) in which AI-identified regions of interest (ROIs) within whole slide images (WSIs) verifiably overlap with pathologist-identified ROIs. Second, we discuss molecular markers (gene expression, molecular subtyping) that are not verified via H&E but rather based on overlap with positive regions on adjacent tissue. Third, we discuss genetic markers (mutations, mutational burden, microsatellite instability, chromosomal instability) that current technologies cannot verify if AI methods spatially resolve specific genetic alterations. Fourth, we discuss the direct prediction of survival to which AIidentified histopathological features quantitatively correlate but are nonetheless not mechanistically verifiable. Finally, we discuss in detail several opportunities and challenges for these one-label-per-slide methods within oncology. Opportunities include reducing the cost of research and clinical care, reducing the workload of clinicians, personalized medicine, and unlocking the full potential of histopathology through new imaging-based biomarkers. Current challenges include explainability and interpretability, validation via adjacent tissue sections, reproducibility, data availability, computational needs, data requirements, domain adaptability, external validation, dataset imbalances, and finally commercialization and clinical potential. Ultimately, the relative ease and minimum upfront cost with which relevant data can be collected in addition to the plethora of available AI methods for outcome-driven analysis will surmount these current limitations and achieve the innumerable opportunities associated with AI-driven histopathology for the benefit of oncology."

We aimed to utilize machine learning (ML) to analyze the risk factors of GA-related OM and predict its risks. Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study. The clinical data of 3532 GA patients were collected and randomly classified into training and validation sets in a ratio of 7:3. Those with or without OM were classified into OM and non-OM (NOM) groups. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator were conducted. We integrated the variables identified through feature importance ranking and further refined the selection process using forward sequential feature selection based on random forest (RF) algorithm before incorporating them into the ML model. We applied six ML algorithms to construct the predictive GA model. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve indicated the model's predictive ability. Also, we established a network risk calculator based on the best performance model. We used Shapley additive interpretation (SHAP) to identify risk factors and to confirm the interpretability of the black box model. We have de-identified all patient details. Results: The ML model, consisting of 13 variables, achieved an optimal predictive performance using the gradient boosting machine (GBM) model, with an impressive area under the curve (AUC) of 0.997 in the test set. Utilizing the SHAP method, we identified crucial factors for OM in GA patients, including LDL, CA724, CEA, AFP, CA125, Hb, CA153, and Ca2+. Additionally, we validated the model's reliability through an analysis of two patient cases and developed a functional online web prediction calculator based on the GBM model. Conclusion: We used the ML method to establish a risk prediction model for GA-related OM and showed that GBM performed best among the six ML models. The model may identify patients with GA-related OM to provide early and timely treatment."

Therefore, recognizing and quantifying DNA damage intensity levels is a substantial issue, which requires further robust and effective approaches. DNA damage has several intensity levels. These levels of DNA damage in malignant cells and in other unhealthy cells are significant in the assessment of lesion stages located in normal cells. There is a need to get more insight from the available biological data to predict, explore and classify DNA damage intensity levels. Herein, the development process relied on the available biological dataset related to DNA damage signaling pathways, which plays a crucial role in DNA damage in the mammalian cell system. The biological dataset that was used in the proposed model consists of 15000 records intensity - concentration-level for a set of five proteins which regulate DNA damage. This research paper proposes an innovative deep learning model, which consists of an attention-based long short term-memory (AT-LSTM) model for DNA damage multi class predictions. The proposed model splits the prediction procedure into dual stages. For the first stage, we adopt the related feature sequences which are inserted as input to the LSTM neural network. In the next stage, the attention feature is applied efficiently to adopt the related feature sequences which are inserted as input to the softmax layer for prediction in the following frame. Our developed framework not only solves the long-term dependence problem of prediction effectively, but also enhances the interpretability of the prediction methods that was established on the neural network. We conducted a novel proposed model on big and complex biological datasets to perform prediction and multi classification tasks. Indeed, the (AT-LSTM) model has the ability to predict and classify the DNA damage in several classes: No-Damage, Low-damage, Medium-damage, High-damage, and Excess -damage. The experimental results show that our framework for DNA damage intensity level can be considered as state of the art for the biological DNA damage prediction domain."

However, missing PRO data may compromise the interpretability and value of the findings. We aimed to report: (1) a non-technical summary of problems caused by missing PRO data; and (2) a systematic review by collating strategies to: (A) minimise rates of missing PRO data, and (B) facilitate transparent interpretation and reporting of missing PRO data in clinical research. Our systematic review does not address statistical handling of missing PRO data. Data sources MEDLINE and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) databases (inception to 31 March 2015), and citing articles and reference lists from relevant sources. Eligibility criteria English articles providing recommendations for reducing missing PRO data rates, or strategies to facilitate transparent interpretation and reporting of missing PRO data were included. Methods 2 reviewers independently screened articles against eligibility criteria. Discrepancies were resolved with the research team. Recommendations were extracted and coded according to framework synthesis. Results 117 sources (55% discussion papers, 26% original research) met the eligibility criteria. Design and methodological strategies for reducing rates of missing PRO data included: incorporating PRO-specific information into the protocol; carefully designing PRO assessment schedules and defining termination rules; minimising patient burden; appointing a PRO coordinator; PRO-specific training for staff; ensuring PRO studies are adequately resourced; and continuous quality assurance. Strategies for transparent interpretation and reporting of missing PRO data include utilising auxiliary data to inform analysis; transparently reporting baseline PRO scores, rates and reasons for missing data; and methods for handling missing PRO data. Conclusions The instance of missing PRO data and its potential to bias clinical research can be minimised by implementing thoughtful design, rigorous methodology and transparent reporting strategies.

Given the role of these responses in exercise adherence, our aim in this review was to explore (a) the utility and feasibility of core affect in stretching-related activities as measured by the Feeling Scale (FS) and/or the Felt Arousal Scale (FAS); (b) the timing of administering these scales; and (c) the scales' applicability and interpretability in this context. Inclusion criteria for studies in this review were experimental and non-experimental studies written in English that based affect assessment on the FS and/or FAS and that applied these scales to participants engaged in physical activity, individually or in groups. We also considered studies that focused on stretching activities that were either isolated or components of a class/activity and studies that used healthy participants of any age. Exclusion criteria were populations with mental health problems, cancer, diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, or diseases likely to alter pain perception or be associated with chronic pain, instrument validation studies, gray literature, and systematic reviews. We searched PubMed, SPORTDiscus and PsycINFO databases, and we added studies retrieved manually from reference sections while following PRISMA guidelines. We used the Effective Public Health Practice Project tool for judging methodological quality of research articles. Our final analyses were based on 12 empirical studies published between 2003 and 2021with a total of 718 participants. Both scales were found to be useful and feasible in the most usual places for exercise, but core affect results cannot be properly interpreted due to variability of study protocols and the absence of guidelines for adequate baseline assessment. Most studies recorded affect responses pre-session, during session, and post-session. We observed no standardized timing or frequency of assessment, and there was high heterogeneity among stretching protocols. Currently, research in core affect assessment of stretching-related activities lacks sufficient methodological quality to draw generalizable conclusions."

Although studies have been conducted to derive dietary patterns among Malaysians, their consistency across subgroups has not been examined. Objective The study aimed to derive dietary patterns empirically and to examine the consistency and generalizability of patterns across sex, ethnicity, and urban status in a working population. Design This was a cross-sectional study using data from the Clustering of Lifestyle Risk Factors and Understanding its Association with Stress on Health and Well-Being among School Teachers in Malaysia study collected between August 2014 and November 2015. Dietary intake was assessed using a food frequency questionnaire, and dietary patterns were derived using factor analysis. Participants/setting Participants were teachers from selected public schools from three states in Peninsular Malaysia (n=4,618). Main outcome measures Dietary patterns derived using factor analysis. Statistical analyses performed Separate factor analysis was conducted by sex, ethnicity, and urban status to identify dietary patterns. Eigenvalue >2, scree plot, Velicer's minimum average partial analysis, and Horn's parallel analysis were used to determine the number of factors to retain. The interpretability of each dietary pattern was evaluated. The consistency and generalizability of dietary patterns across subgroups were assessed using the Tucker congruence coefficient. Results There was no subgroup-specific dietary pattern found. Thus, dietary patterns were derived using the pooled sample in the final model. Two dietary patterns (Western and Prudent) were derived. The Western dietary pattern explained 15.4% of total variance, characterized by high intakes of refined grains, animal-based foods, added fat, and sugar-sweetened beverages as well as fast food. The Prudent dietary pattern explained 11.1% of total variance and was loaded with pulses, legumes, vegetables, and fruits. Conclusions The derived Western and Prudent dietary patterns were consistent and generalizable across subgroups of sex, ethnicity, and urban status. Further research is needed to explore associations between these dietary patterns and chronic diseases."

It is a promising patient-centric analysis that enables effective integrated healthcare interventions specific for each segment. Although widely applied, there is no systematic review on the clinical application of data-driven population segmentation analysis.MethodsWe carried out a systematic literature search using PubMed, Embase and Web of Science following PRISMA criteria. We included English peer-reviewed articles that applied data-driven population segmentation analysis on empirical health data. We summarized the clinical settings in which segmentation analysis was applied, compared and contrasted strengths, limitations, and practical considerations of different segmentation methods, and assessed the segmentation outcome of all included studies. The studies were assessed by two independent reviewers.ResultsWe retrieved 14,514 articles and included 216 articles. Data-driven population segmentation analysis was widely used in different clinical contexts. 163 studies examined the general population while 53 focused on specific population with certain diseases or conditions, including psychological, oncological, respiratory, cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal conditions. Variables used for segmentation in the studies are heterogeneous. Most studies (n=170) utilized secondary data in community settings (n=185). The most common segmentation method was latent class/profile/transition/growth analysis (n=96) followed by K-means cluster analysis (n=60) and hierarchical analysis (n=50), each having its advantages, disadvantages, and practical considerations. We also identified key criteria to evaluate a segmentation framework: internal validity, external validity, identifiability/interpretability, substantiality, stability, actionability/accessibility, and parsimony.ConclusionsData-driven population segmentation has been widely applied and holds great potential in managing population health. The evaluations of segmentation outcome require the interplay of data analytics and subject matter expertise. The optimal framework for segmentation requires further research."

These steps are particularly challenging due to the curse of dimensionality and the presence of technical and biological noise. A promising strategy for overcoming these challenges is the incorporation of pre-existing transcriptomics data in the identification of differentially expressed (DE) genes. This approach has the potential to improve the quality of selected genes, increase classification performance, and enhance biological interpretability. While a number of methods have been developed that use pre-existing data for differential expression analysis, existing methods do not leverage the identities of experimental conditions to create a robust metric for identifying DE genes. Results In this study, we propose a novel differential expression and feature selection method-GEOlimma-which combines pre-existing microarray data from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) with the widely-applied Limma method for differential expression analysis. We first quantify differential gene expression across 2481 pairwise comparisons from 602 curated GEO Datasets, and we convert differential expression frequencies to DE prior probabilities. Genes with high DE prior probabilities show enrichment in cell growth and death, signal transduction, and cancer-related biological pathways, while genes with low prior probabilities were enriched in sensory system pathways. We then applied GEOlimma to four differential expression comparisons within two human disease datasets and performed differential expression, feature selection, and supervised classification analyses. Our results suggest that use of GEOlimma provides greater experimental power to detect DE genes compared to Limma, due to its increased effective sample size. Furthermore, in a supervised classification analysis using GEOlimma as a feature selection method, we observed similar or better classification performance than Limma given small, noisy subsets of an asthma dataset. Conclusions Our results demonstrate that GEOlimma is a more effective method for differential gene expression and feature selection analyses compared to the standard Limma method. Due to its focus on gene-level differential expression, GEOlimma also has the potential to be applied to other high-throughput biological datasets."

Currently, there are no effective tools for the diagnosis and risk assessment of early bone metastasis in NSCLC patients. This study employed machine learning to analyze serum indicators that are closely associated with bone metastasis, aiming to construct a model for the timely detection and prognostic evaluation of bone metastasis in NSCLC patients. Methods The derivation cohort consisted of 664 individuals with stage IV NSCLC, diagnosed between 2015 and 2018. The variables considered in this study included age, sex, and 18 speci fi c serum indicators that have been linked to the occurrence of bone metastasis in NSCLC. Variable selection used multivariate logistic regression analysis and Lasso regression analysis. Six machine learning methods were utilized to develop a bone metastasis diagnostic model, assessed with Area Under the Curve (AUC), Decision Curve Analysis (DCA), sensitivity, speci fi city, and validation cohorts. External validation used 113 NSCLC patients from the Medical Alliance (2019 - 2020). Furthermore, a prospective validation study was conducted on a cohort of 316 patients (2019 - 2020) who were devoid of bone metastasis, and followed-up for at least two years to assess the predictive capabilities of this model. The model ' s prognostic value was evaluated using Kaplan - Meier survival curves. Findings Through variable selection, 11 serum indictors were identi fi ed as independent predictive factors for NSCLC bone metastasis. Six machine learning models were developed using age, sex, and these serum indicators. A random forest (RF) model demonstrated strong performance during the training and internal validation cohorts, achieving an AUC of 0.98 (95% CI 0.95 - 0.99) for internal validation. External validation further con fi rmed the RF model ' s effectiveness, yielding an AUC of 0.97 (95% CI 0.94 - 0.99). The calibration curves demonstrated a high level of concordance between the anticipated risk and the observed risk of the RF model. Prospective validation revealed that the RF model could predict the occurrence of bone metastasis approximately 10.27 +/- 3.58 months in advance, according to the results of the SPECT. An online computing platform (https://bonemetastasis.shinyapps.io/shiny_cls_ 1model/) for this RF model is publicly available and free-to-use by doctors and patients. Interpretation This study innovatively employs age, gender, and 11 serological markers closely related to the mechanism of bone metastasis to construct an RF model, providing a reliable tool for the early screening and prognostic assessment of bone metastasis in NSCLC patients. However, as an exploratory study, the fi ndings require further validation through large-scale, multicenter prospective studies."

Over the past few decades, different clinical diagnostic algorithms have been proposed to diagnose malignant melanoma in its early stages.

As the core component of the ES, fault diagnosis accuracy is positively correlated to the precision of the knowledge base. But it is difficult for users to understand the knowledge obtained from the original dataset utilizing the existing knowledge extraction method. Therefore, it is of great significance to extract easy-to-understand and exact rules from the NN framework. This paper proposes a hybrid extraction framework to perform the rule extraction for overcoming this drawback. First, an improved adaptive genetic algorithm (GA) using a logistic function, namely LAGA, is proposed to solve the traditional GA's insufficient prediction performance issue. Compared with the other three mainstream adaptive GAs, the experiment results of optimizing six selected test functions by these GA variants show that the LAGA algorithm's convergence accuracy and speed have been greatly improved, especially for high latitude functions. On this basis, a rule extraction method based on the symbol rule and NN, namely the LAGA-BP framework, is discussed in this manuscript to classify the real-valued attributes. This framework obtains hidden knowledge (knowledge refinement process) by NN and further transforms the acquired hidden knowledge into more easy-to-understand rule knowledge (rule extraction process). The execution of the LAGA-BP framework could be separated into two phases. The first phase is to optimize a back propagation NN (BPNN) using the LAGA and refine prediction classification knowledge over the optimized BPNN. In the second phase, an attribute reduction algorithm using multi-layered NN (SD algorithm) based on two different superposed networks is used in this framework to reduce data-set attributes and then uses the K-means clustering algorithm to extract the if-then rule from the simplified attributes. The Wisconsin breast cancer dataset is used as a case study to reveal the correctness and robustness of the proposed LAGA-BP method. Consulting relevant medical personnel and referencing relevant data shows that the rules extracted using this method help verify the diagnosis results, thus verifying the proposed framework's feasibility and practicality."

Grayscale ultrasound images (GSIs) and Microflow images (MFIs) of the placentas were collected from all patients during routine obstetric examinations. On the basis of intelligent extraction and features fusion, after quantities of training and optimization, the classification model named GMNet (the intelligent network based on GSIs and MFIs) was introduced for differentiating the placental features of normal and HDP pregnancies. The distributions of placental features extracted by the deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) were visualized by Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection for Dimension Reduction (UMAP). Metrics including sensitivity, speci-ficity, accuracy, and the area under the curve (AUC) were used to score the model. Finally, placental tissue samples were randomly selected for microscopic analyses to prove the interpretability and effectiveness of the GMNet model.Results: Compared with the Normal group in ultrasonic images, the light spots were rougher and the parts with focal cystic or hypoechogenic lesions were increased in the HDP groups. The overall diagnostic performance of the GMNet model depending on the region of interest (ROI) was excellent (AUC: 97%), with a sensitivity of 90.0%, a specificity of 93.5%, and an accuracy of 93.1%. The fusion features of GSIs and MFIs in the placenta showed a higher discriminative power than single-mode features (fusion features vs GSI features vs MFI features, 97.0% vs 91.2% vs 94.8%). Furthermore, according to the microscopic analysis, unevenly distributed villi, increased syncyte nodules and aggregated intervillous cellulose deposition were particularly frequent in the HDP cases.Conclusions: The GMNet model could sensitively identify abnormal changes in the placental microstructure in pregnancies with HDP."

The HRQoL questionnaires for patients with dysphagia were assessed using the quality criteria for the measurement properties of health status questionnaires proposed by Terwee et al. and Timmerman et al. 29 studies published between 2008 and 2020 were included. The questionnaires described in these 29 studies were translated into 19 languages and culturally adapted to 21 countries. The adapted questionnaires were based on the Swallowing quality of life questionnaire (SWAL-QOL) by Mchorney et al., the Dysphagia Handicap Index (DHI) by Silbergleit et al., the M.D. Anderson Dysphagia Inventory (MDADI) by Chen et al., and the Eating Assessment Tool-10 (EAT-10) by Belafsky et al. It was found that the questionnaires were reliable and valid instruments for the assessment of dysphagia-related HRQoL, but the quality criteria for cultural adaptation and validation were not strictly followed, especially in the categories of criterion validity, agreement, responsiveness, and interpretability. In conclusion, although the questionnaires were found to be both reliable and valid, the quality criteria should be considered and strictly followed in the cultural adaptation and validation process in the future."

However, more low-effect background semantic information appeared in the feature maps, feature channels, and class activation maps, which caused a serious impact on the accuracy and interpretability of LSCC grading. While the traditional transformer block makes extensive use of parameter attention, the model overlearns the low-effect background semantic information, resulting in ineffectively reducing the proportion of background semantics. Therefore, we propose an end-to-end network with transformers constrained by learned-parameter-free attention (LA-ViT), which improve the ability to learn high-effect target semantic information and reduce the proportion of background semantics. Firstly, according to generalized linear model and probabilistic, we demonstrate that learned-parameter-free attention (LA) has a stronger ability to learn highly effective target semantic information than parameter attention. Secondly, the first-type LA transformer block of LA-ViT utilizes the feature map position subspace to realize the query. Then, it uses the feature channel subspace to realize the key, and adopts the average convergence to obtain a value. And those construct the LA mechanism. Thus, it reduces the proportion of background semantics in the feature maps and feature channels. Thirdly, the second-type LA transformer block of LA-ViT uses the model probability matrix information and decision level weight information to realize key and query, respectively. And those realize the LA mechanism. So, it reduces the proportion of background semantics in class activation maps. Finally, we build a new complex semantic LSCC pathology image dataset to address the problem, which is less research on LSCC grading models because of lacking clinically meaningful datasets. After extensive experiments, the whole metrics of LA-ViT outperform those of other state-of-the-art methods, and the visualization maps match better with the regions of interest in the pathologists' decision-making. Moreover, the experimental results conducted on a public LSCC pathology image dataset show that LA-ViT has superior generalization performance to that of other state-of-the-art methods."

Deep learning has been applied to the CT denoising problem successfully. However, the use of deep learning requires large amounts of data to train deep convolutional networks (CNNs). Moreover, due to the large parameter count, such deep CNNs may cause unexpected results. Purpose In this study, we introduce a novel CT denoising framework, which has interpretable behavior and provides useful results with limited data. Methods We employ bilateral filtering in both the projection and volume domains to remove noise. To account for nonstationary noise, we tune the sigma parameters of the volume for every projection view and every volume pixel. The tuning is carried out by two deep CNNs. Due to the impracticality of labeling, the two-deep CNNs are trained via a Deep-Q reinforcement learning task. The reward for the task is generated by using a custom reward function represented by a neural network. Our experiments were carried out on abdominal scans for the Mayo Clinic the cancer imaging archive (TCIA) dataset and the American association of physicists in medicine (AAPM) Low Dose CT Grand Challenge. Results Our denoising framework has excellent denoising performance increasing the peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) from 28.53 to 28.93 and increasing the structural similarity index (SSIM) from 0.8952 to 0.9204. We outperform several state-of-the-art deep CNNs, which have several orders of magnitude higher number of parameters (p-value [PSNR] = 0.000, p-value [SSIM] = 0.000). Our method does not introduce any blurring, which is introduced by mean squared error (MSE) loss-based methods, or any deep learning artifacts, which are introduced by wasserstein generative adversarial network (WGAN)-based models. Our ablation studies show that parameter tuning and using our reward network results in the best possible results. Conclusions We present a novel CT denoising framework, which focuses on interpretability to deliver good denoising performance, especially with limited data. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art deep neural networks. Future work will be focused on accelerating our method and generalizing it to different geometries and body parts."

However, the lack of interpretability limits application of these models. We thus aimed to construct and validate an interpretable and generalized computed tomography (CT) radiomics model to evaluate the pathological invasiveness in patients with a solitary pulmonary nodule in order to improve the management of these patients.Methods: We retrospectively enrolled 248 patients with CT-diagnosed solitary pulmonary nodules. Radiomic features were extracted from nodular region and perinodular regions of 3 and 5 mm. After coarse to-fine feature selection, the radiomics score (radscore) was calculated using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator logistic method. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to determine the invasiveness-related clinicoradiological factors. The clinical-radiomics model was then constructed using the logistic and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) algorithms. The Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) method was then used to explain the contributions of the features. After removing batch effects with the ComBat algorithm, we assessed the generalization of the explainable clinical-radiomics model in two independent external validation cohorts (n=147 and n=149).Results: The clinical-radiomic XGBoost model integrating the radscore, CT value, nodule length, and crescent sign demonstrated better predictive performance than did the clinical-radiomics logistic model in assessing pulmonary nodule invasiveness, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) of 0.889 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.848-0.927] in the training cohort. The SHAP algorithm illustrates the contribution of each feature in the final model. The specific model decision process was visualized using a tree-based decision heatmap. Satisfactory generalization performance was shown with AUCs of 0.889 (95% CI, 0.823-0.942) and 0.915 (95% CI, 0.851-0.963) in the two external validation cohorts.Conclusions: An interpretable and generalized clinical-radiomics model for predicting pulmonary nodule invasibility was constructed to help clinicians determine the invasiveness of pulmonary nodules and devise assessment strategies in an easily understandable manner."

Embracing the current big data era, medical physicists equipped with these state-of-the-art tools should be able to solve pressing problems in modern radiation oncology. Here, a review of the basic aspects involved in ML/DL model building, including data processing, model training, and validation for medical physics applications is presented and discussed. Machine learning can be categorized based on the underlying task into supervised learning, unsupervised learning, or reinforcement learning; each of these categories has its own input/output dataset characteristics and aims to solve different classes of problems in medical physics ranging from automation of processes to predictive analytics. It is recognized that data size requirements may vary depending on the specific medical physics application and the nature of the algorithms applied. Data processing, which is a crucial step for model stability and precision, should be performed before training the model. Deep learning as a subset of ML is able to learn multilevel representations from raw input data, eliminating the necessity for hand crafted features in classical ML. It can be thought of as an extension of the classical linear models but with multilayer (deep) structures and nonlinear activation functions. The logic of going deeper is related to learning complex data structures and its realization has been aided by recent advancements in parallel computing architectures and the development of more robust optimization methods for efficient training of these algorithms. Model validation is an essential part of ML/DL model building. Without it, the model being developed cannot be easily trusted to generalize to unseen data. Whenever applying ML/DL, one should keep in mind, according to Amara's law, that humans may tend to overestimate the ability of a technology in the short term and underestimate its capability in the long term. To establish ML/DL role into standard clinical workflow, models considering balance between accuracy and interpretability should be developed. Machine learning/DL algorithms have potential in numerous radiation oncology applications, including automatizing mundane procedures, improving efficiency and safety of auto-contouring, treatment planning, quality assurance, motion management, and outcome predictions. Medical physicists have been at the frontiers of technology translation into medicine and they ought to be prepared to embrace the inevitable role of ML/DL in the practice of radiation oncology and lead its clinical implementation."

In order to avoid these drawbacks, adaptive therapy can be planned for patients at risk, if the prediction is obtained timely, before or during the early phase of treatment. Artificial intelligence can address the problem, by learning from examples and building classification models. In particular, fuzzy logic has shown its suitability for medical applications, in order to manage uncertain data, and to build transparent rule-based classifiers. In previous works, clinical, dosimetric and image-based features were considered separately, to find different possible predictors of parotid shrinkage. On the other hand, a few works reported possible image-based predictors of xerostomia, while the combination of different types of features has been little addressed. Objective: This paper proposes the application of a novel machine learning approach, based on both statistics and fuzzy logic, aimed at the classification of patients at risk of i) parotid gland shrinkage and ii) 12-months xerostomia. Both problems are addressed with the aim of individuating predictors and models to classify respective outcomes. Methods: Knowledge is extracted from a real dataset of radiotherapy patients, by means of a recently developed method named Likelihood-Fuzzy Analysis, based on the representation of statistical information by fuzzy rule-based models. This method enables to manage heterogeneous variables and missing data, and to obtain interpretable fuzzy models presenting good generalization power (thus high performance), and to measure classification confidence. Numerous features are extracted to characterize patients, coming from different sources, i.e. clinical features, dosimetric parameters, and radiomics-based measures obtained by texture analysis of Computed Tomography images. A learning approach based on the composition of simple models in a more complicated one allows to consider the features separately, in order to identify predictors and models to use when only some data source is available, and obtaining more accurate results when more information can be combined. Results: Regarding parotid shrinkage, a number of good predictors is detected, some already known and confirmed here, and some others found here, in particular among radiomics-based features. A number of models are also designed, some using single features and others involving models composition to improve classification accuracy. In particular, the best model to be used at the initial treatment stage, and another one applicable at the half treatment stage are identified. Regarding 12-months toxicity, some possible predictors are detected, in particular among radiomics-based features. Moreover, the relation between final parotid shrinkage rate and 12-months xerostomia is evaluated. The method is compared to the naive Bayes classifier, which reveals similar results in terms of classification accuracy and best predictors. The interpretable fuzzy rule-based models are explicitly presented, and the dependence between predictors and outcome is explained, thus furnishing in some cases helpful insights about the considered problems. Conclusion: Thanks to the performance and interpretability of the fuzzy classification method employed, predictors of both parotid shrinkage and xerostomia are detected, and their influence on each outcome is revealed. Moreover, models for predicting parotid shrinkage at initial and half radiotherapy stages are found. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

New evidence about graphic visualization formats for PROMs scores has become available. This systematic literature review evaluated evidence for graphic visualization formats of PROMs data in clinical practice for patients and clinicians, for both individual and group level PROMs data. Methods Studies published between 2000 and 2020 were extracted from CINAHL, PubMed, PsychInfo, and Medline. Studies included patients >= 18 years old in daily clinical practice. Papers not available in English, without full-text access, or that did not specifically describe visualization of PROMs data were excluded. Outcomes were: visualization preferences; interpretation accuracy; guidance for clinical interpretation. Results Twenty-five out of 789 papers were included for final analysis. Most frequently studied formats were: bar charts, line graphs, and pie charts. Patients preferred bar charts and line graphs as these were easy and quick for retrieving information about their PROMs scores over time. Clinicians' interpretation accuracy and preferences were similar among graphic visualization formats. Scores were most often compared with patients' own previous scores; to further guide clinical interpretation, scores were compared to norm population scores. Different 'add-ons' improved interpretability for patients and clinicians, e.g. using colors, descriptions of measurement scale directionality, descriptive labels, and brief definitions. Conclusion There was no predominant graphical visualization format approach in terms of preferences or interpretation accuracy for both patients and clinicians. Detailed clarification of graph content is essential. Plain English summary Patient-Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) capture patients' self-reported health through the use of questionnaires. PROMs measure health related quality of life, daily functioning, and symptom experience, which are becoming increasingly important to incorporate in clinical practice for individual patient management. To present PROMs within clinical practice, raw or summarized PROMs scores can be visualized in graphical formats. To be useful during clinical encounters, both patients and clinicians ought to interpret such formats correctly. New evidence about graphic visualization formats for PROMs scores has become available. Therefore, we systematically reviewed the literature to evaluate evidence for graphic visualization formats of PROMs data in clinical practice. In 25 included papers, most studies used graphical formats like bar charts, line graphs, and pie charts for presenting PROMs scores. There was no predominant graphical visualization format approach in terms of preferences or interpretation accuracy for both patients and clinicians. Patients preferred bar charts and line graphs as these were easy and quick for retrieving information about their PROMs scores over time. Clinicians' interpretation accuracy and preferences were similar among graphic visualization formats. The graphical interpretation of PROMs data for patients and clinicians can be improved by using colors, descriptions of measurement scale directionality, descriptive labels, and brief definitions."

J	"Bhattacharya, A; Li, Y; Love, M"				"Bhattacharya, Arjun; Li, Yun; Love, Michael, I"			MOSTWAS: Multi-Omic Strategies for Transcriptome-Wide Association Studies	PLOS GENETICS			English	Article							BREAST-CANCER; SUSCEPTIBILITY LOCI; EQTL ANALYSIS; TRANS-EQTLS; EXPRESSION; GENES; SCHIZOPHRENIA; MECHANISMS; IMPUTATION; FRAMEWORK	"Author summary Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) are a powerful strategy to study gene-trait associations by integrating genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with gene expression datasets. TWAS increases study power and interpretability by mapping genetic variants to genes. However, traditional TWAS consider only variants that are close to a gene and thus ignores important variants far away from the gene that may be involved in complex regulatory mechanisms. Here, we present MOSTWAS (Multi-Omic Strategies for TWAS), a suite of tools that extends the TWAS framework to include these distal variants. MOSTWAS leverages multi-omic data of regulatory biomarkers (transcription factors, microRNAs, epigenetics) and borrows from techniques in mediation analysis to prioritize distal variants that are around these regulatory biomarkers. Using simulations and real public data from brain tissue and breast tumors, we show that MOSTWAS improves upon traditional TWAS in both predictive performance and power to detect gene-trait associations. MOSTWAS also aids in identifying possible mechanisms for gene regulation using a novel added-last test that assesses the added information gained from the distal variants beyond the local association. In conclusion, our method aids in detecting important risk genes for traits and disorders and the possible complex interactions underlying genetic regulation within a tissue. Traditional predictive models for transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) consider only single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) local to genes of interest and perform parameter shrinkage with a regularization process. These approaches ignore the effect of distal-SNPs or other molecular effects underlying the SNP-gene association. Here, we outline multi-omics strategies for transcriptome imputation from germline genetics to allow more powerful testing of gene-trait associations by prioritizing distal-SNPs to the gene of interest. In one extension, we identify mediating biomarkers (CpG sites, microRNAs, and transcription factors) highly associated with gene expression and train predictive models for these mediators using their local SNPs. Imputed values for mediators are then incorporated into the final predictive model of gene expression, along with local SNPs. In the second extension, we assess distal-eQTLs (SNPs associated with genes not in a local window around it) for their mediation effect through mediating biomarkers local to these distal-eSNPs. Distal-eSNPs with large indirect mediation effects are then included in the transcriptomic prediction model with the local SNPs around the gene of interest. Using simulations and real data from ROS/MAP brain tissue and TCGA breast tumors, we show considerable gains of percent variance explained (1-2% additive increase) of gene expression and TWAS power to detect gene-trait associations. This integrative approach to transcriptome-wide imputation and association studies aids in identifying the complex interactions underlying genetic regulation within a tissue and important risk genes for various traits and disorders."

Recognizing these specific determinants is crucial, yet it is also vital to establish a reliable and precise prognostic model for estimating individual survival outcomes. OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study are twofold: first, to create an array of interpretable machine learning (ML) models developed for predicting survival outcomes among SCG patients; and second, to integrate these models into an easily navigable online calculator to showcase their prospective clinical applicability. STUDY DESIGN: This was a retrospective, population-based cohort study aiming to predict the outcomes of interest, which were binary categorical variables, in SCG patients with ML models. PATIENT SAMPLE: The National Cancer Database (NCDB) was utilized to identify adults aged 18 years or older who were diagnosed with histologically confirmed SCGs between 2010 and 2019. OUTCOME MEASURES: The outcomes of interest were survival outcomes at three specific time points postdiagnosis: 1, 3, and 5 years. These outcomes were formed by combining the Vital Status and Last Contact or Death (Months from Diagnosis) variables. Model performance was evaluated visually and numerically. The visual evaluation utilized receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, precision-recall curves (PRCs), and calibration curves. The numerical evaluation involved metrics such as sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, area under the PRC (AUPRC), area under the ROC curve (AUROC), and Brier Score. METHODS: We employed five ML algorithms - TabPFN, CatBoost, XGBoost, LightGBM, and Random Forest - along with the Optuna library for hyperparameter optimization. The models that yielded the highest AUROC values were chosen for integration into the online calculator. To enhance the explicability of our models, we utilized SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) for assessing the relative significance of predictor variables and incorporated partial dependence plots (PDPs) to delineate the influence of singular variables on the predictions made by the top performing models. RESULTS: For the 1-year survival analysis, 4,913 patients [5.6% with 1-year mortality]; for the 3year survival analysis, 4,027 patients (11.5% with 3-year mortality]; and for the 5-year survival analysis, 2,854 patients (20.4% with 5-year mortality) were included. The top models achieved AUROCs of 0.938 for 1-year mortality (TabPFN), 0.907 for 3-year mortality (LightGBM), and 0.902 for 5-year mortality (Random Forest). Global SHAP analyses across survival outcomes at different time points identified histology, tumor grade, age, surgery, radiotherapy, and tumor size as the most significant predictor variables for the top -performing models. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates ML techniques can develop highly accurate prognostic models for SCG patients with excellent discriminatory ability. The interactive online calculator provides a tool for assessment by physicians (https://huggingface.co/spaces/MSHS-NeurosurgeryResearch/NCDB-SCG). Local interpretability informs prediction influences for a given individual. External validation across diverse datasets could further substantiate potential utility and generalizability. This robust, interpretable methodology aligns with the goals of precision medicine, establishing a foundation for continued research leveraging ML's predictive power to enhance patient counseling.

A promising avenue is the secondary use of electronic health records (EHRs), where patient data are analyzed to conduct clinical and translational research. Methods based on machine learning to process EHRs are resulting in improved understanding of patient clinical trajectories and chronic disease risk prediction, creating a unique opportunity to derive previously unknown clinical insights. However, a wealth of clinical histories remains locked behind clinical narratives in free-form text. Consequently, unlocking the full potential of EHR data is contingent on the development of natural language processing (NLP) methods to automatically transform clinical text into structured clinical data that can guide clinical decisions and potentially delay or prevent disease onset. Objective: The goal of the research was to provide a comprehensive overview of the development and uptake of NLP methods applied to free-text clinical notes related to chronic diseases, including the investigation of challenges faced by NLP methodologies in understanding clinical narratives. Methods: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed and searches were conducted in 5 databases using clinical notes,  natural language processing, and  chronic disease and their variations as keywords to maximize coverage of the articles. Results: Of the 2652 articles considered, 106 met the inclusion criteria. Review of the included papers resulted in identification of 43 chronic diseases, which were then further classified into 10 disease categories using the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision. The majority of studies focused on diseases of the circulatory system (n=38) while endocrine and metabolic diseases were fewest (n=14). This was due to the structure of clinical records related to metabolic diseases, which typically contain much more structured data, compared with medical records for diseases of the circulatory system, which focus more on unstructured data and consequently have seen a stronger focus of NLP. The review has shown that there is a significant increase in the use of machine learning methods compared to rule-based approaches; however, deep learning methods remain emergent (n=3). Consequently, the majority of works focus on classification of disease phenotype with only a handful of papers addressing extraction of comorbidities from the free text or integration of clinical notes with structured data. There is a notable use of relatively simple methods, such as shallow classifiers (or combination with rule-based methods), due to the interpretability of predictions, which still represents a significant issue for more complex methods. Finally, scarcity of publicly available data may also have contributed to insufficient development of more advanced methods, such as extraction of word embeddings from clinical notes. Conclusions: Efforts are still required to improve (1) progression of clinical NLP methods from extraction toward understanding; (2) recognition of relations among entities rather than entities in isolation; (3) temporal extraction to understand past, current, and future clinical events; (4) exploitation of alternative sources of clinical knowledge; and (5) availability of large-scale, de-identified clinical corpora."

This multicenter retrospective study aims to identify reliable clinical and radiomic features to build machine learning models that predict progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients. Methods. Between 2010 and 2020 pre-treatment contrast-enhanced CT scans of 287 pathology-confirmed PDAC patients from two sites of the Hopital Universitaire de Bruxelles (HUB) and from 47 hospitals within the HUB network were retrospectively analysed. Demographic, clinical, and survival data were also collected. Gross tumour volume (GTV) and non-tumoral pancreas (RPV) were semi-manually segmented and radiomics features were extracted. Patients from two HUB sites comprised the training dataset, while those from the remaining 47 hospitals of the HUB network constituted the testing dataset. A three-step method was used for feature selection. Based on the GradientBoostingSurvivalAnalysis classifier, different machine learning models were trained and tested to predict OS and PFS. Model performances were assessed using the C-index and Kaplan-Meier curves. SHAP analysis was applied to allow for post hoc interpretability. Results. A total of 107 radiomics features were extracted from each of the GTV and RPV. Fourteen subgroups of features were selected: clinical, GTV, RPV, clinical & GTV, clinical & GTV & RPV, GTV-volume and RPV-volume both for OS and PFS. Subsequently, 14 Gradient Boosting Survival Analysis models were trained and tested. In the testing dataset, the clinical & GTV model demonstrated the highest performance for OS (C-index: 0.72) among all other models, while for PFS, the clinical model exhibited a superior performance (C-index: 0. 70). Conclusions. An integrated approach, combining clinical and radiomics features, excels in predicting OS, whereas clinical features demonstrate strong performance in PFS prediction."
